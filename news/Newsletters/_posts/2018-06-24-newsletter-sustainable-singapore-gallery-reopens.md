#### Sustainability Singapore Gallery Re-opens! Come Visit!  

On 1 June, the revamped Sustainable Singapore Gallery was launched by Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources. The futuristic gallery features a plethora of digital displays and interactive elements, providing an overview of Singapore’s commitment to sustainable development.

The gallery’s six zones trace Singapore’s response to environmental and sustainability issues.  

With interactive digital displays and multi-sensory exhibits, exploring the gallery is sure to be an immersive experience. For instance, one of the exhibits is a carbon calculator that estimates the size of your carbon footprint and suggests ways to reduce it.

Another crowd favourite, this installation simulates pedalling through the streets of Singapore. The video showcases measures that have been made to make Singapore more bike-friendly, for example, the addition of parking spaces and bicycle crossings.  

Besides charting the milestones that brought about the quality living environment Singaporeans enjoy today, the focus in many parts of the gallery is on the challenges ahead, and the steps needed to keep Singapore smart and green.  

There’s bound to be something for everyone, so come on down to explore the gallery and learn more about Singapore’s sustainability journey!  

The Sustainable Singapore Gallery is open from 9am to 6pm daily. Admission is free. Closed on Tuesdays.
