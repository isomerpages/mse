#### Easy ways you can do your part  

Smart decision making at home or at work could mean lower energy use, lower emissions and a better world for everyone. We can start by using energy, water and other resources more carefully so that we minimise wastage.  

Here are some small tips that can make a huge long-term impact:  

**Use Air Conditioning Sensibly**  
Is it too cold? Raise the temperature setting on your air conditioner. Better yet, use a fan instead of an air-conditioner. You can save money and energy just by doing this!  

**Switch Off Appliances and Equipment When Not in Use**  
Just like you need to rest, your fan, television, computer and other electronic devices at home or work need a rest too. Give them a break by switching them off when you do not need them. Remember, they still consume energy while on standby mode, so switch them off at off all the mains!  

**Public Transportation is a Better Option**  
Travelling long-distance? Why not take the bus or mass-rapid transit (MRT) instead of driving? Is your destination close by? Hop on your bicycle or take a leisurely stroll instead. Consider these travel options before you take any trip.  

**Drive Greener Cars**  
If you need a car to get around, choose one that emits less carbon. Look out for the mandatory Fuel Economy Labelling Scheme (FELS) labels, which will tell you the carbon emissions and fuel efficiency performance of the car model. With the introduction of the Carbon Emissions Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) in January 2013, you get to enjoy a rebate as well as when you buy a vehicle that emits less carbon.  

**Buy Energy-efficient Appliances**  
Buying a new appliance for home or work? Choosing to spend a little more to buy a more energy-efficient model will not only lower your energy usage, but will lower your bills in the long term too! To lower your energy use, choose appliances that carry three or four green ticks on their energy labels as they are more energy efficient.  

**Reduce, Reuse and Recycle**  
By choosing to use less, less will be thrown away. Whatever we do throw away, we can make sure our waste gets reused by channelling materials such as paper, metal, plastic and glass for recycling. Using recycled products also helps reduce carbon emissions because producing them uses much less energy.  

Avoid using disposable utensils, cups and plastic bags whenever possible. Reduce waste by bringing your own utensils with you for meals and using your own reusable bag for grocery shopping. Also, think about whether you really need the packaging or wrapping when you buy things.
