		<p>MSE would like to alert the public to a scam involving the impersonation of investment platform <a href="https://www.genzero.co">GenZero.</a> Individuals would deceive an email, or a phone text message, that encourages them to purchase carbon credits through a mobile application. They will also receive a separate email with links to a confirmation page, bearing the logos of the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Ministry of National Development (MND) and the National Environment Agency (NEA). Upon registration on the mobile application, the individual will be asked to key in their personal banking details for payment.</p>
