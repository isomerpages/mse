#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Uptake of Local Produce by Major Institutional Buyers
 
**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what steps are being taken to increase the uptake of locally produced food by major institutional buyers which supply key Government entities including the SAF, public hospitals, prisons, welfare homes and senior care centres; and (b) whether the Government will consider incentivising these buyers through long-term contracts, contractual requirements or price support measures to promote the market viability of Singapore's local food producers in line with the "30 by 30" goal.
 
**Answer:**
 
1 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has been supporting the industry in achieving greater offtake for local produce through various initiatives. This includes incorporating a criterion in Government procurement to give additional points to businesses who have undertaken sustainability initiatives, such as being recognised under the Farm-to-Table Recognition Programme (FTTRP) for procuring locally grown produce. The additional points increase their chances of securing government catering contracts, including those with key Government entities.
 
2 Beyond working with suppliers on contracts with Government entities, SFA has also been working with the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprises Federation Limited (SAFEF) to facilitate long-term commercial contracts between farmers and food businesses. This provides producers with certainty of demand and pricing while providing food businesses with the convenience of access to a wide array of local produce from different farms, and constancy of supplies of good quality produce. In May 2024, SAFEF partnered FairPrice to launch a pilot to sell aggregated locally farmed vegetables and marine tilapia under the brands “SG Farmers’ Market” and “The Straits Fish” at 44 and 20 FairPrice outlets respectively. This helped our local produce gain more visibility among consumers and increased sales. SFA also works closely with our supermarket retailers to promote local produce through prominent in-store marketing materials and fairs to encourage shoppers to buy local produce and educate them on the benefits of local produce.
 
3 Beyond the local market, farms can leverage the Singapore brand and our food safety recognition to export their products. SFA has also compiled market reports and import requirements of different countries and regions into a Library of Export Market Requirements on SFA’s website to support farms looking to export their produce and works closely with other government agencies to facilitate Singapore’s food trade flows and to support businesses in gaining market access.
 
4 While the Government will do its part, the viability of our local agri-food sector also depends on consumer demand for their products. Consumers can play a part by choosing to purchase local produce which can be easily recognised by the red SG Fresh Produce logo or dine at food businesses under the FTTRP. Local produce is fresher, lasts longer and incurs less transport miles as it need not travel long distances or for long periods of time before reaching consumers.
 
5 SFA will continue to explore initiatives to scale demand offtake for local produce. Together, we can continue to safeguard Singapore’s food security.
