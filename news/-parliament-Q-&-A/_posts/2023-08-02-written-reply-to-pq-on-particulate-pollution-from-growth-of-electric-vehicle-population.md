#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Particulate Pollution from Growth of Electric Vehicle Population by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Murali Pillai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider undertaking a study (i) to understand how much particulate pollution has and will be generated from vehicle tyres and brakes, especially having regard to the growing number of electric vehicles which are heavier and likely to create more wear on tyres and (ii) to identify steps to be taken to reduce the level of pollution.

**Answer:**
 
1 Particulate matter is generated by vehicle tyres and brakes, including those of Electric Vehicles which tend to be heavier and create more wear on tyres. We are tracking this issue closely and monitoring international developments in research and regulation.
 
 2 The National Environment Agency has also invited research proposals on studies on particulate matter generated by tyres and brakes under the Air Quality Monitoring and Control Funding Initiative. This will improve our understanding of this issue and serve as a reference as we determine what steps we need to take to address such pollution.
