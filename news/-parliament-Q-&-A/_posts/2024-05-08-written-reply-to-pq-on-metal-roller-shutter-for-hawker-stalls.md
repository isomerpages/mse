#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Metal Roller Shutter for Hawker Stalls by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Lim Biow Chuan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the National Environment Agency (NEA) will consider replacement of the metal roller shutter for all hawker stalls with a lighter aluminium roller shutter to assist older hawkers in hawker centres managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators.

**Answer:**

1 Roller shutters, whether made of steel or aluminium, are relatively easy to operate if they are maintained well. NEA ensures that hawker stalls, including their roller shutters, are handed over in good working condition to stallholders when they commence their tenancies. Stallholders should subsequently carry out regular maintenance works, such as oiling their roller shutters.

2 NEA also regularly engages stallholders on the ground and will work with stallholders to service and repair the roller shutters, where necessary.
