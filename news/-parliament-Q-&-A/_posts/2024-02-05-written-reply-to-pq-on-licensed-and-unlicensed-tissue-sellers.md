#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on licensed and unlicensed tissue sellers by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Leong Mun Wai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the current number of licensed and unlicensed tissue sellers in Singapore; (b) whether any increase in the number of unlicensed tissue sellers has been observed since 2020; (c) what efforts have been made by Government agencies to reach out to unlicensed tissue sellers who are eligible for Government support schemes; and (d) whether any enforcement efforts have been conducted against unlicensed tissue sellers.

**Answer:** 

1 As of end 2023, there are 28 licensed tissue sellers. We do not track the number of unlicensed tissue sellers.

2 The Vulnerable-In-Community (VIC) Network, led by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and comprising government agencies and community groups, was set up in November 2019. The VIC engages vulnerable individuals, including unlicensed tissue sellers, to find out their needs and link them up for support. Since its inception, the VIC network has reached out to more than 160 individuals and assisted 90 individuals to receive support, such as ComCare or employment assistance. However, a number of the unlicensed tissue sellers reject VICâ€™s offers for help, preferring to continue with their activities. The VIC Network continues to engage them to convince them to consider other options.

3 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) works with MSF to refer unlicensed tissue sellers to the VIC network. SFA may take enforcement action against unlicensed tissue sellers if they persist in operating illegally.
