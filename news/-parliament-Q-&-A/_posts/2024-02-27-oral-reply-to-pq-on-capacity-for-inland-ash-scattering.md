#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on capacity for inland ash scattering by Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Carrie Tan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of rising land demands for storing cremation niches and urns (a) how quickly can the Ministry ramp up the capacity for inland ash scattering as the main method for the management of cremated remains; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider launching a programme to make inland ash scattering the default method for managing remains of non-Muslim Singaporeans and provide an opt-out option to those who do not prefer it.

**Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency has been offering Inland Ash Scattering (or IAS) as an option for cremated ashes since May 2021. We have and will continue to encourage the take-up of IAS by the public. There are currently sufficient time slots available at the Garden of Peace located in Choa Chu Kang Cemetery for those who choose to scatter the ashes of their deceased family members. A second IAS facility, the Garden of Serenity at the new Mandai Crematorium Complex, is scheduled to be opened in 2025. This will further increase our capacity for IAS.

2 For many Singaporeans, managing the cremated remains of their loved ones is a sensitive and emotive issue. We have been working with religious leaders and the community to raise awareness of IAS where it is not prohibited by the respective religions, while still continuing to respect the preferences and religious practices of the deceased and their bereaved families. Presently, we do not have any plans to make IAS the default option for managing cremated ashes.
