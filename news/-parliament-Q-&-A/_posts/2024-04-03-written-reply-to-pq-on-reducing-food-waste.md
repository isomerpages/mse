#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Reducing Food Waste by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Liang Eng Hwa:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether more can be done to further reduce the amount of food waste generated; and (b) whether the infrastructure and ecosystem to treat and recycle food waste have been efficient so far.

**Answer:**

1 Food waste is one of the three priority waste streams under the Zero Waste Masterplan. We have implemented a range of efforts to holistically reduce the amount of food waste generated and improve the recycling rate for food waste. 

2 First, we have passed regulations under the Resource Sustainability Act to progressively require, from 2024, large commercial and industrial food waste generators, including hotels, shopping malls, and food manufacturers, to segregate their food waste for treatment or conversion into useful products, and to submit annual food waste reports. The reporting will help raise awareness on the amount of food waste generated and encourage building managers to work with their occupants to reduce food waste. 

3 Second, we are building up our food waste treatment capacity. A Food Waste Treatment Facility (FWTF) is being constructed as part of the upcoming Integrated Waste Management Facility at Tuas Nexus and will serve as an off-site treatment option for owners and operators of premises who segregate their food waste. When the FWTF is operational, the additional biogas produced will boost electricity generation.

4 Third, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, the National Environment Agency has supported the development of the Singapore Standards on food waste management, as well as published food waste minimisation guidebooks to help the industry reduce food waste across the supply chain. Where there is unsold or excess food that is still suitable for consumption, consumers and food establishments can donate them to food distribution organisations such as The Food Bank Singapore, Food from the Heart and Willing Hearts. 

5 As some of these measures have only been implemented recently, it is too soon to evaluate their overall efficiency.
