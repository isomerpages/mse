#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Checks on Egg Farms by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
 
**Mr Don Wee:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how does the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) check on all farms from which Singapore imports eggs; and (b) how does SFA strike a balance between food security and food safety.
 
**Answer:**
 
1 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) adopts a science-based approach to assess and manage food safety risks, including for eggs, and does so through its regulatory regimes as well as consumer education. 

2 SFA accredits and approves all overseas farms before they can export eggs to Singapore. The farms need to meet SFA’s food safety and animal health requirements, including being free of Salmonella Enteritidis. At import, eggs are subject to SFA’s inspection and testing regime to ensure food safety. Inspected consignments that fail will not be allowed for sale in Singapore. 

3 Food safety remains paramount even as we enhance Singapore’s food security. Even as we diversify our sources of meat and eggs, we ensure that all new sources are subjected to a robust regulatory regime.
