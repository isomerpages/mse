#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Inspection of Catered Food for Migrant Workers by Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has carried out inspections on licensed caterers providing food for migrant workers to ensure that food is prepared within four hours of the workers' lunch and dinner times; (b) if not, whether SFA will consider carrying out such inspections; and (c) if yes, how many inspections are carried out in 2023 and 2024.  

**Answer:**  

1 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) conducts inspections on all licensed food caterers to ensure adherence to food safety requirements. As part of inspections, SFA will ensure that all catered food bear a time-stamp that indicates the date and time by which the food should be consumed. From January 2023 to September 2024, SFA has conducted around 3,600 inspections on licensed food caterers.
