#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Designated Smoking Area by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Gan Thiam Poh:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider making it compulsory for premises managers to set up at least one designated smoking area in the outdoor areas of their premises provided these are not places where smoking is prohibited.  

**Answer:**  

1 We currently have no plans to mandate that premises managers set up designated smoking areas at the outdoor areas of their premises. The setting up of designated smoking areas should be carefully considered as the proliferation of such smoking facilities needs to be balanced against the risk of inadvertently normalising smoking. We urge smokers to be considerate and socially responsible when smoking at public places.
