#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Safety Standards of Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Singapore's Drinking Water by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Singapore Food Agency will consider setting safety standards for common per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in Singapore’s drinking water, in light of the United States’ announcement on 10 April 2024 about the setting of safety standards for five individual PFAS in their drinking water.

**Answer:**

1 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) sets drinking water quality standards under the Environmental Public Health (Water Suitable for Drinking) Regulations, taking into account international guidelines such as those established by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

2 Specific to PFAS in drinking water, the WHO is developing a set of guidelines. SFA will review whether to develop local regulatory limits for PFAS, after WHO’s finalised guidelines are published. Since 2016, PUB has been monitoring PFAS in Singapore’s drinking water through its comprehensive water quality monitoring programme. PFAS levels in Singapore’s drinking water remain below the limits set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

3 SFA and PUB will continue to monitor developments relating to PFAS to ensure the continued supply of safe drinking water for all in Singapore.
