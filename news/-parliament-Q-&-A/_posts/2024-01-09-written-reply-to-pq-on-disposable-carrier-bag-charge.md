#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on disposable carrier bag charge by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Foo Mee Har:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the  Environment to what extent has the mandatory charge for plastic bags at  supermarket chains resulted in (i) a reduction in the amount of supermarket  plastic bags being used and (ii) the promotion of wider recycling efforts, as  evidenced by increased participation in recycling initiatives.  

**Answer:**  

1 Since its implementation on 3 July 2023, the mandatory disposable carrier  bag charge has generally been well-received. The obligated larger supermarket  operators have observed approximately 50% to 80% reduction in the number of  disposable carrier bags that consumers have taken. We are heartened that the  supermarket operators have also indicated that they intend to use the proceeds  from the bag charge to support environmental or social causes.   

2 The disposable carrier bag charge is a behavioural nudge which encourages  the public to adopt sustainable habits such as reducing the use of disposable  carrier bags. We hope that the adoption of such sustainable habits will lead to  wider behavioural change. However, as the bag charge was implemented less than  a year ago, it may be too early to tell if it has also resulted in increased  participation in other recycling initiatives. It is also difficult to directly attribute  any changes in recycling habits to the bag charge, as the charge focuses on  reducing usage rather than recycling.
