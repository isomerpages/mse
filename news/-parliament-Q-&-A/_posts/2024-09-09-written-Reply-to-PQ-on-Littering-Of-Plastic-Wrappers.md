#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Littering Of Plastic Wrappers by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Lim Biow Chuan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the
Environment whether NEA will ban the use of plastic wrappers for chopsticks
to prevent the littering of such plastic wrappers at food centres.

**Answer:**  

1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) does not have plans to ban the
use of plastic wrappers for chopsticks. To tackle table littering, since 2021, we
have made it mandatory for diners to clear their used trays, crockery and litter,
including plastic wrappers for chopsticks, after their meals at hawker centres,
coffeeshops and food courts. As chopstick plastic wrappers tend to be very light,
we would like to remind diners to take extra care that the wrappers do not get
blown away and end up as litter.

2 NEA has been working with various stakeholders, including the Hawkersâ€™
Associations and our appointed operators, to reduce the use of disposables for
dine-in meals at hawker centres. For example, the use of disposable crockery and
cutlery for dine-in meals has been disallowed at new hawker centres since
November 2016, and for all new stallholders in existing hawker centres since
September 2018. Under GreenGov.SG, public agencies have been working with food and beverage outlets in public sector premises to phase out disposables for
dine-in meals as far as possible.
