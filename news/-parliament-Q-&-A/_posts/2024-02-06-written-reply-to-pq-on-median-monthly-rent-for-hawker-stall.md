#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on median monthly rent for hawker stall by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and  the Environment in each year of the last 10 years (a) what is the median  monthly rent for a stall at hawker centres managed by NEA-appointed  operators; and (b) what is the relative difference of such rents compared to  NEA-managed hawker centres in a comparable locale, in dollar and percentage  terms. 

**Answer:**

1 The median stall rental at Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres  (SEHCs) is generally comparable to that at similar hawker centres managed by  the National Environment Agency (NEA), taking into account stall sizes and  amenities. In 2023, the median monthly stall rent at SEHCs and non-subsidised  stalls at NEA-managed hawker centres were $1,700 and $1,625, respectively.  

2 Median rents at SEHC and NEA hawker centres have remained stable  since the commencement of the SEHC centres.
