#### Written Rely to Parliamentary Question on Consolidating Tray Return Counters in Food Establishments by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Yeo Wan Ling:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment given that the Tray Return Programme has been in force for 12 months with little incidences of infractions, whether the Ministry will consider reducing and consolidating the tray return counters in food establishments.

**Answer:**

1 In general, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) do not specify the number of tray and crockery return points that food establishments should provide. Food establishments are required to provide sufficient tray and crockery return points for the diners to return their used trays and crockery taking into account factors including the number of diners, size of the establishment, visibility and ease of accessing the tray and crockery return points. Based on feedback received from members of the public, NEA and SFA may engage food establishments to adjust the number of tray and crockery return points, if required.
