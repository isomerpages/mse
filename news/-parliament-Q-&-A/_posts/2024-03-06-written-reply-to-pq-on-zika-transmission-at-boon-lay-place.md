#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on zika transmission at Boon Lay Place by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the potential Zika transmission at Boon Lay Place (a) how was it detected; (b) what steps were immediately taken following the detection; (c) how is the Ministry tracking it in the area; and (d) what specific measures are being implemented to prevent the spread of the Zika virus.
**Answer:**

1  In December 2023, one Zika case was reported at Boon Lay Place. Although no further cases have been reported in the area, the National Environment Agency (NEA)â€™s enhanced surveillance through monitoring mosquitoes collected from Gravitraps and wastewater testing revealed persistent Zika virus signals, which suggested possible Zika transmission.

2  Since November 2023, NEA has been conducting intensive vector control operations at the Boon Lay area where dengue cases were also reported. These include indoor spraying of insecticides at residential premises to kill adult mosquitoes, and larviciding at common areas to destroy any mosquito breeding. Such efforts will mitigate both dengue and Zika transmission, given that they are both spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. NEA officers and grassroots leaders have also conducted outreach activities in the vicinity to raise awareness on the need to remove stagnant water to prevent mosquito breeding.

3  NEA will continue to monitor mosquito and wastewater samples from the area for further Zika virus signals. The Ministry of Health has also alerted doctors to be vigilant and to test for Zika among patients with clinically compatible symptoms, especially for individuals residing or working in the Boon Lay area.

4  Zika is generally a mild and self-limiting disease. However, in rare cases, pregnant women who are infected can give birth to babies with certain birth defects, including microcephaly. We therefore take all cases of Zika detection seriously and urge residents, especially pregnant women, to monitor their health closely and take personal precautions to prevent mosquito bites, such as by spraying insecticides in dark corners, applying insect repellent, and wearing long sleeves and pants.
