#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Hawkers Succession Scheme by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment since the launch of the Hawkers Succession Scheme (a) what is the number of veteran hawkers who have been onboarded to the programme; and (b) what is the number of potential successors who have (i) completed the apprenticeship (ii) completed the food tasting evaluation and (iii) successfully taken over the stall.

**Answer:**

1 The Hawkers Succession Scheme (HSS) helps to sustain the hawker trade and heritage, by helping retiring veteran hawkers to pass down their culinary skills, recipes and hawker stalls to aspiring successors.

2 Since the launch of the HSS on 1 Jan 2022, seven veteran hawkers have successfully enrolled for the scheme. Two of them have completed the transfer of their stalls to their successors, while a third is in the process of doing so. Two of the remaining veteran hawkers have been successfully matched with aspiring successors. Of these, one of the aspiring successors has completed the apprenticeship stage while the other is pending the culinary skills test to assess his suitability. The other two veteran hawkers are awaiting suitable successors.

3 The National Environment Agency (NEA) will learn from the successful transfers and continue to engage interested veteran hawkers and aspiring successors to participate in the scheme.
