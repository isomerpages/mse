#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Carbon Dioxide Levels in Construction Temporary Quarters and Factory-Converted Dormitories by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with respect to the carbon dioxide measurements taken specifically from workersâ€™ sleeping rooms in migrant worker dormitories, what is the current number and percentage of rooms surveyed that had carbon dioxide levels below 1,100 ppm respectively from (i) Construction Temporary Quarters and (ii) Factory-Converted Dormitories.
 
**Answer:**
 
1 In 2021, the National Environment Agency and the Ministry of Manpower conducted a one-off study on the ventilation in migrant worker dormitories using carbon dioxide measurements as a proxy. There are currently no plans to conduct another study. As such, the information requested by the Member is not available.
