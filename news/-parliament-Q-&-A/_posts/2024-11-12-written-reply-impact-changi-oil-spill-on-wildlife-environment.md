#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Impact of Changi Oil Spill on Wildlife and the Environment
 
 
**Mr Christopher De Souza:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether there is any impact on local wildlife and the environment following the oil spill which occurred off Changi on 28 October 2024 during a bunkering operation.
 
**Answer:**
 
1 On 28 October 2024, an estimated five tonnes of oil was reported to have overflowed into the sea off Changi during a bunkering operation. While there was no oil sighted at sea nor in the vicinity of the incident and ashore, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and other agencies had taken precautionary measures including the deployment of containment and absorbent booms at key areas such as East Coast Park.
 
2 Thus far, NParks has not observed any oil at biodiversity-sensitive areas. NParks has commenced long-term monitoring of the ecological impact on our marine habitats and biodiversity, and is working with the scientific community to conduct research to better understand the long-term impacts.
