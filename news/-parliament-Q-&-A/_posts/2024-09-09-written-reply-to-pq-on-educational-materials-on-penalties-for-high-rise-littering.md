#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Educational Materials on Penalties for High-Rise Littering by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Lim Biow Chuan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the
Environment whether NEA will produce more educational materials to remind
residents on the penalties for high-rise littering.

**Answer:**  

1 As part of a multi-pronged approach to deter high-rise litterbugs, the
National Environment Agency (NEA) undertakes public education to increase
public awareness of the adverse environmental and social impacts, and penalties
associated with high-rise littering. These efforts aim to influence behaviour and
cultivate good habits. They include social media posts, news articles and
cleanliness campaigns. NEA also works with Town Councils to deploy physical
standees and posters at HDB blocks to highlight ongoing surveillance and
statistics on high-rise littering offences. NEA also conducts targeted educational
outreach to households in the stack of residential units that is affected by high-
rise littering. NEA will continue to refine our educational materials and outreach
efforts as needed, and support our partners including Town Councils to do more
to deter high-rise littering.

2 High-rise littering is an anti-social and irresponsible act which affects
public safety in addition to environmental hygiene. NEA will continue to encourage members of the public to exercise social graciousness and take
personal ownership in keeping Singapore clean.
