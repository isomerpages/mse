#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Enforcement Actions Against Illegal Parking for Waste Collection Operations by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Gan Thiam Poh:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the National Environment Agency will consider assisting the public waste collectors to equip their waste collection trucks with surveillance cameras to collect evidence for enforcement actions against illegal parking at the restricted area in front of HDB flats' central refuse chutes which hamper the daily waste collection operations.

**Answer:**

1 Our Public Waste Collectors (PWCs) generally do not face issues arising from illegally parked vehicles at the central refuse chute area of HDB blocks as there are operational workarounds. Where PWC workers encounter illegally parked vehicles that hamper waste collection operations, they can take photos of the vehicles and notify the relevant authorities via the one-stop OneService app, LifeSG app or parking enforcement hotline.
