#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Quality of Cleaning Vendors by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
 
**Ms Joan Pereira:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Government will consider implementing measures to assess and review the quality of cleaning vendors.
 
**Answer:**
 
1 Since September 2014, all cleaning businesses providing general cleaning services are required to be licensed by the National Environment Agency (NEA). The licensing requirements include a trained workforce and payment of Progressive Wage Model wages and bonuses to resident cleaners. Training requirements for cleaners have also been enhanced from 31 December 2022 to align with the Tripartite Cluster for Cleanerâ€™s recommendations in 2021.
 
2 As announced earlier this year, NEA will implement the revised cleaning business licensing framework from 1 January 2024. The revised framework will have three classes of licences to differentiate cleaning businesses according to their capabilities, and allow buyers of cleaning services to make more informed decisions when procuring such services. For example, the highest Class 1 licence requires cleaning businesses to ensure that their cleaning workforce is trained in at least three Workforce Skills Qualifications training modules, to meet a higher paid-up capital requirement and to have a good track record, including having no convictions under the relevant written laws. Attainment of the Class 1 licence will provide greater assurance that these cleaning businesses are equipped with more resources, experience and capabilities to undertake larger cleaning contracts.
