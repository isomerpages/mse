#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Emissions Factors Registry by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Christopher de Souza:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the new Emission Factors Registry, which is meant to help businesses meet their climate reporting needs, has encouraged more firms to voluntarily register and commit to transitioning to low-carbon output.

**Answer:**

1 The Singapore Emission Factors Registry is an initiative led by the Singapore Business Federation, with the support of the Government. It will help companies report their carbon emission more accurately and easily. As it is an upcoming initiative that is scheduled to commence in end-2024, the requested data is currently not available.
