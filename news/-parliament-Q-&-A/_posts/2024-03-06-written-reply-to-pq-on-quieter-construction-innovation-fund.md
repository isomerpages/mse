#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on quieter construction innovation fund by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Yip Hon Weng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what was the uptake of the $2 million Quieter Construction Innovation Fund that was launched by NEA on 1 April 2019 to incentivise the construction industry to adopt innovative quieter construction equipment and methods; and (b) what innovative quieter construction equipment and methods have been introduced since 2019.

**Answer:**

1  The National Environment Agency had provided funding support for quieter construction and noise control equipment since 2014, including through the Quieter Construction Innovation Fund (QCIF) from 2019 to 2021.

2  $1.5 million in grants have been disbursed under the QCIF to support contractors and suppliers in defraying the cost of adopting quieter methods and construction equipment, such as jack-in piling machines, hydraulic crushers, quieter generators and rebar bending machines.
