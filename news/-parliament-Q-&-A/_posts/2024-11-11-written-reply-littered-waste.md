#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Littered Waste by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
 
**Ms See Jinli Jean:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what are the amounts of littered waste collected yearly from 2021 to 2024 at local urban, recreational and nature environments respectively; (b) what are the measured environmental impact including carbon footprint of these littered waste for such period; and (c) what is the progress in respect of the on-going initiatives towards a litter-free Singapore.
 
**Answer:**
 
1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) oversees the cleaning of public spaces such as roads, pavements and certain private estates in Singapore, while Town Councils manage the cleaning of HDB estates. NEA does not track the total amount of litter collected from different areas such as public spaces, recreational parks; as all types of litter and organic waste such as leaves are collected together when cleaning is conducted.
 
2 MSE and NEA have been ramping up efforts and working closely with stakeholders to keep Singapore clean, especially this year which we have designated as the Year of Public Hygiene. We adopt a multi-pronged approach that combines enforcement against litterbugs and partnership with the community. NEA has stepped up anti-littering enforcement, including more than 100 anti-littering enforcement blitzes at hotspots with higher offence rates and public feedback reports.
 
3 In addition to enforcement efforts, NEA works with partners such as residents, community leaders, Town Councils, schools and other organisations to foster collective action and social responsibility to keep our public spaces clean. So far this year, our partners have organised more than 130 activities that promote a stronger culture of cleanliness.
 
4 There are also other initiatives such as the Public Hygiene Council (PHC)â€™s annual Keep Singapore Clean campaign and CleanPods, which advocate the value of maintaining cleanliness beyond our own homes and fostering the habit of picking up after oneself. To make it convenient and sustainable for residents and volunteers to help keep our neighbourhoods and environment clean, PHC has a network of 21 CleanPods distributed around parks, beaches, and housing estates that provides access to shared clean-up tools.
 
5 A whole-of-society approach is needed to keep our public spaces clean. I urge everyone to play their part in keeping Singapore a clean, green and sustainable home.
