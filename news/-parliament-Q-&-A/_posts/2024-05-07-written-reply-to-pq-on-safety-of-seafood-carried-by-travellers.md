#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Safety of Seafood Products Carried into Singapore by Travellers by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Joan Pereira:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment how does the Ministry ensure that the seafood products which travellers carry to Singapore for personal consumption are not contaminated and are safe to consume.

**Answer:**

1 Food safety is a joint responsibility. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) does not regulate the safety of food products carried in by travellers for their personal consumption. Travellers should exercise caution when purchasing food products overseas, and be aware of the potential food safety risks associated with bringing back and consuming those food products. For example, to minimise the risk of bacteria growth that can cause food poisoning, travellers should avoid carrying perishable food products.
   
2 Travellers should refer to SFAâ€™s website for information on the permitted limits for food products carried in for personal consumption, as well as food safety tips on buying, handling and storing different types of food.
