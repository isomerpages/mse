#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on commercial and industrial food waste by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry measures the amount of food waste from large commercial and industrial food waste generators, including hotels, malls, food manufacturers, central kitchens, food caterers and food storage warehouses; (b) whether the amount of food waste has increased since 2021; (c) what legislative or other measures are in place reduce the amount of avoidable food waste generated from these sources; and (d) how does the Ministry work with businesses and charities to distribute unexpired food to needy residents.

**Answer:**  

1 The total amount of food waste generated in 2022 was 813,000 tonnes, close to the 817,000 tonnes in 2021. About 40% of Singapore’s total food waste generated was from commercial and industrial sources.

2 Under the Resource Sustainability Act, large commercial and industrial food waste generators, including hotels, shopping malls, and food manufacturers, will be progressively required from 2024 to segregate their food waste for treatment or conversion into useful products, and to submit food waste reports annually. The reporting will help raise awareness on the amount of food waste generated and encourage building managers to work with their occupants to minimise food waste.

3 In collaboration with industry stakeholders, the National Environment Agency has published food waste minimisation guidebooks to help the industry reduce food waste across the supply chain. Where there is unsold or excess food that is still suitable for consumption, consumers and food establishments can donate them to food distribution organisations such as The Food Bank Singapore, Food from the Heart and Willing Hearts. Members of the public may also refer to NEA’s website for more information on food distribution organisations.
