#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Engaging Community Sustainability by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Yip Hon Weng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether an update can be provided on the Ministry's community engagements with businesses and individuals to encourage more sustainable practices and reduce carbon footprint; (b) how does the Ministry address the issue of significant packaging waste arising from more purchases done online in international marketplaces; and (c) what is the progress towards the key milestones for a more sustainable economy under the Singapore Green Plan 2030.

**Answer:**

1  Since the launch of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 in 2021, my Ministry and its Statutory Boards have been engaging stakeholders across different segments of the society, including individuals, businesses, schools, Non- Government Organisations (NGOs) and community groups to promote environmentally sustainable practices.

2  The National Environment Agency (NEA) has embarked on various public education initiatives to encourage households to reduce waste, including through its Say YES to Waste Less and Recycle Right campaigns. Some assuring trends have been observed: according to NEA’s 2023 survey on household recycling, 72 per cent of households reported that they recycled their waste materials in 2023, compared to 64 per cent in 2021. A higher proportion of respondents were also aware of common items that can be deposited in the blue recycling bins and recycling chutes.

3  PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, engages diverse partners including schools, grassroots organisations, public agencies, NGOs, businesses and building owners to promote water conservation. In 2023, PUB engaged more than 400 partners and 2,000 participants for its anchor event of Singapore World Water Day.

4  My Ministry has also co-delivered and co-created several initiatives with our stakeholders and the larger community. These include Go Green SG, a nation-wide sustainability movement to rally citizens, organisations, and the community to take collective action towards a more environmentally sustainable Singapore. The inaugural Go Green SG in 2023 saw over 70,000 participants across more than 300 activities organised by 160 partners. More than 90% of participants said that they were encouraged to lead a more sustainable lifestyle after participating in the activities.

5  To support individuals and businesses who want to start ground-up projects that advance environmental sustainability and engage the community, the SG Eco Fund has awarded $9.3 million to support more than 200 initiatives, including education and outreach on sustainable practices. More than 300,000 people were engaged through these initiatives.

6  Singapore has made good progress in developing a sustainable economy since our Green Plan was launched in 2021. The member may refer to MTI and MSE’s Committee of Supply speeches delivered on 1 and 4 March 2024 for the latest updates and initiatives to build a more sustainable economy.
