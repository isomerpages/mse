#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Carbon Budget by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Government has plans to include Singaporeâ€™s share of international transport emissions in its carbon budget; and (b) whether it is planning to set carbon emission targets for such emissions.

**Answer:**

1 Singapore reports our greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory in accordance with the reporting requirements for Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Based on the UNFCCC reporting requirements, emissions from international transport (aviation and marine bunkers) do not accrue to the national GHG inventory of the countries providing bunkering, but are reported separately as an information item.

2 The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) lead the efforts on setting emissions targets for, and decarbonising, international transport. These organisations have set for their respective sectors a global ambition of achieving net zero GHG emissions by or around 2050. As a Member State of both the ICAO and IMO, Singapore participates actively in discussions at the ICAO and IMO to decarbonise the civil aviation and maritime sectors. We are committed to contributing to these global ambitions collectively with other ICAO and IMO members.  

3 The Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint, launched by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) in 2022, sets out our focus areas in driving the decarbonisation of the maritime industry. The strategies and initiatives will be reviewed and refined to respond to the dynamic developments in the global maritime decarbonisation landscape. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) also published the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint in February this year, outlining our initiatives to achieve net zero for domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.
