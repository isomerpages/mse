#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on time stamps for catered meals  by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and  the Environment in each year of the past five years, how many investigations  have been brought against caterers or companies for (i) failing to provide a time  stamp for every catered meal and (ii) serving food beyond four hours from the  time the food is cooked and kept between five to 60 degree Celsius. 

**Answer:**

1 In the past five years, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has taken 18 enforcement actions against caterers and companies for failing to affix a  “consume by” time-stamp, and 29 enforcement actions against caterers and  companies for affixing time-stamp labels with false or misleading information  on the “ready-to-eat” or “consume by” time. 

2 SFA has not taken any enforcement actions against caterers or  companies for serving food beyond four hours from the time the food is cooked, based on the time-stamp.
