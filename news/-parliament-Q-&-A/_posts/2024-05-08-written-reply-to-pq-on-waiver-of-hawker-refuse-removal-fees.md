#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Waiver of Hawker Refuse Removal Fees by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Lim Biow Chuan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether NEA will waive a hawker stallâ€™s refuse removal fees whenever a hawker centre is closed for renovations.

**Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) or its appointed operator will seek waiver from the Public Waste Collector (PWC) for the refuse collection fee payable by the stallholders whenever a hawker centre is to be closed for Repairs and Redecoration (R&R). To date, these waiver requests have typically been granted by the PWCs.
