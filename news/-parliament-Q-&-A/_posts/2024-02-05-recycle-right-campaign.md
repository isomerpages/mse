#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on recycle right campaign by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Ong Hua Han:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment how successful has the Recycle Right Campaign been in reducing contamination in recycling bins.

**Answer:**  

1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) launched the Recycle Right Campaign in November 2019 to raise awareness on what can and cannot be recycled, how to incorporate recycling into aspects of daily life, and how to avoid contamination of recyclables.

2 NEAâ€™s 2023 survey on household recycling found an assuring trend: 72 per cent of households reported that they recycled their waste materials in 2023, compared to 64 per cent in 2021. In addition, a higher proportion of respondents were aware of common items that can be deposited in the blue recycling bins and recycling chutes. NEA will monitor how the improved awareness of recycling right translates to lower contamination of recyclables over time.

3 I urge everyone to do their part to recycle right, especially during this festive season when households may be spring cleaning. Only clean and recyclable items should be placed in the blue recycling bins or recycling chutes. Electronic waste should be recycled at designated e-waste collection points, and reusable items such as furniture and clothes should be donated or disposed of separately.
