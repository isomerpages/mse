#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on heat stress by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the  Environment (a) whether further studies are being conducted to ascertain the  socio-economic impact of mitigation efforts for the different emissions  scenarios laid out in Singapore's Third National Climate Change Study; (b) if  so, what mitigation efforts will the Ministry be looking at; and (c) if not, why  so. 

**Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the  Environment in light of the Third National Climate Change Study which  reported that annual mean temperatures are projected to rise by 0.55 degree  Celsius per decade under the high emissions scenario, (a) whether the Ministry  will commission studies of the effects of heat stress on vulnerable groups of  the population, such as the elderly, children and outdoor manual workers in the  construction industry; and (b) if so, what is the timeline for such studies. 

**Answer:**

1 Singapore's Third National Climate Change Study, or V3, produced an  updated set of climate projections for Singapore and the Southeast Asia region  up to the year 2100, and beyond. V3 studied the three different emission  pathways of high, medium and low greenhouse gas emissions to explore the  range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the Southeast Asian region.  

2 These updated climate projections enable the Government to develop  and refine our climate adaptation plans to ensure that Singapore remains resilient to the impact of climate change. Agencies involved in the Resilience Working Group include URA, NParks, PUB and NEA, which are tasked to  review and update the adaption plans in their respective areas.  

3 One example is Singapore’s heat resilience efforts. Agencies including URA and NParks adopt a science-based and proactive heat resilience strategy  to help Singaporeans cope with rising temperatures.  a. First, we are implementing national-level strategies to cool our urban  environment, such as by infusing more greenery and scaling up the  use of cool materials on buildings. b. Second, we are strengthening the community’s resilience to heat. For  example, MSE and NEA launched the Heat Stress Advisory last year for the general population. Working with MOH, we advised the more  vulnerable segments, such as the elderly and children, to exercise greater caution. MOM and MOE also issue sector-specific guidelines  for outdoor workers and students respectively. c. Third, we are deepening our understanding of the science behind how rising temperatures affect Singapore and our residents.

4 We are investigating the impact of heat on specific population segments.  We have commissioned studies under the Cooling Singapore 2.0 project to  investigate the impact of heat on different segments of the population. NEA  has also launched the second grant call under the Climate Impact Science  Research Programme for new research proposals in areas such as food security,  human health, and sea level rise.  

5 MSE will continue to work with other agencies to better understand the  effects of climate change on Singapore and our population, and put in place the  necessary adaptation and risk mitigation measures. We will ensure that the built  environment is resilient and prepared for a range of climate scenarios, and  empower the community to take the necessary protective measures.
