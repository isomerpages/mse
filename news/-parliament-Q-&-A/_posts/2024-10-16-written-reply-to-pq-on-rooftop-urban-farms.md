#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Rooftop Urban Farms by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether there are further plans to offer more rooftop urban farms for tender; and (b) whether there are plans to offer a longer lease period of beyond three years for such farms.  

**Answer:**  

1 As part of greenery intensification under the Housing Development Board (HDB) Green Towns Programme, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and HDB tendered out 16 Multi-Storey Car Park (MSCP) sites in 2020 and 2021 to pilot commercial urban farming. All sites were awarded on three-year tenancies renewable for up to two additional terms of three years each. Although the production volume is relatively small, it brings local production closer to the community, thereby raising awareness and support for local produce.  
  
2 SFA and HDB consider multiple factors when identifying suitable MSCP sites for commercial urban farming. These include the utilisation rate of the MSCPs, the loading which the rooftops at each site can bear, the availability of water and electricity supply, waste discharge facilities, as well as the current and future development plans for the surrounding HDB blocks. SFA is monitoring the progress of the existing commercial MSCP farms before deciding on future tenders and whether to extend the tenancy duration. There are currently no immediate plans to launch new tenders for commercial farming at MSCP sites. In the meantime, entities that wish to take up longer-term commercial farming can consider participating in SFAâ€™s land and sea space tenders which offer more space and longer leases to contribute to local production and food security.
