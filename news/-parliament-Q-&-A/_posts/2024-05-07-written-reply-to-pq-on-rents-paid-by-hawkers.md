#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Rents Paid by Hawkers by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what is the current average, 25th and 75th percentile of rents being paid by hawkers operating at (i) NEA-managed hawker centres and (ii) Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres.

**Answer:**

1 As of 31 Mar 2024, the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile monthly stall rental of cooked food stalls were $1,500, $1,700 and $1,950 at Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres (SEHC), and $1,350, $1,600 and $1,800 for non-subsidised stalls at similar hawker centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA). In general, stall sizes at SEHCs are larger and enjoy better amenities.
