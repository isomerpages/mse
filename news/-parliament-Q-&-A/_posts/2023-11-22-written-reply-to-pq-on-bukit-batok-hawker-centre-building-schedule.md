#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Bukit Batok Hawker Centre building schedule by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Murali Pillai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether an update may be provided on the expected start and completion dates for building the Bukit Batok hawker centre that will be co-located with the assisted living residential flats pilot in Bukit Batok Town as announced during the Committee of Supply debates in 2019.

**Answer:**

The hawker centre at Bukit Batok, which is co-located with assisted living residential flats, is currently in the construction stage. As the hawker centre is part of a larger HDB development, the completion date of the hawker centre will be aligned with the overall progress of the HDB development, which will be completed in 2024. NEA is coordinating with HDB on the project timeline and will share the expected completion date of the hawker centre when the plans are confirmed.
