#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on COP28 by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Christopher de Souza:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the  Environment how will the four paradigm shifts announced at the 2023 UN  Climate Change Conference impact the Sustainable Development Goals that  Singapore has committed to. 

**Mr Christopher de Souza:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the  Environment whether the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference provided an  opportunity for Singapore to further relations with the global community to  tackle common issues such as agri-food production, water management and  renewable energy. 

**Mr Christopher de Souza:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the  Environment whether an update can be provided on the outcome of Singapore’s  participation at the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference (COP28), especially  in regard to the Sustainable Development Goals. 

**Answer:**

1 At the UN Climate Change Conference 2023, also known as COP-28,  the UAE COP-28 Presidency announced four paradigm shifts: (a) fast-tracking  the energy transition; (b) transforming climate finance; (c) putting nature, people, lives, and livelihoods at the heart of climate action, and (d) ensuring  inclusivity. The four paradigm shifts were aimed at galvanising the global  community at COP-28 to close the implementation gap needed to keep the  temperature goals of the Paris Agreement within reach. 

2 These shifts are aligned with Singapore’s climate ambition and the  United Nations’ (UN) 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Singapore’s  participation at COP-28 helped to further the Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) in several ways.  

3 First, we supported the UAE COP-28 Presidency and the global shared  climate agenda by, inter alia, co-facilitating ministerial consultations on climate  mitigation and co-chairing the joint contact group for the First Global  Stocktake of the Paris Agreement. These efforts contributed to the successful  adoption of the UAE Consensus. The UAE Consensus calls on countries to  transition away from fossil fuels, accelerate the phasedown of unabated coal  power, phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and triple renewable energy  and double energy efficiency globally by 2030. These are important initiatives that will better position the world towards achieving Sustainable Development  Goal (SDG) 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy and SDG 13 on Climate Action. 

4 Second, Singapore contributed to global efforts in strengthening resource resilience in key areas such as food and water, in line with SDG 2 on  Zero Hunger and SDG 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation. Singapore was among  159 countries that signed the COP-28 UAE Declaration on Sustainable  Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems and Climate Action. The Declaration’s  intent is to strengthen the resilience of agriculture and food systems to the  impacts of climate through closer collaboration and partnerships. We also participated actively in key discussions like the Informal Ministerial Meeting  on the Follow-up of the UN 2030 Water Conference, which continued  discussion on key issues such as strategies to improve global water quality and  sanitation.  

5 Third, Singapore launched initiatives and platforms to facilitate  cooperation towards the SDGs. These include the FAST-P (Financing Asia’s  Transition Partnership) blended finance initiative which aims to mobilise up to  US$5 billion (S$6.7 billion) for Asia’s energy transition, and agreements on  carbon market cooperation with countries such as Costa Rica, Fiji, Rwanda,  Senegal and Papua New Guinea. The COP-28 Singapore Pavilion also hosted  more than 70 events that drew over 6,000 visitors, and served as a platform for  facilitating partnerships in sectors such as finance, water and food, transport  and nature-based solutions to address sustainable development challenges. 

6 Singapore’s active participation at COP-28 is a testament to our support  for global efforts to implement the SDGs. Singapore supports the UAE  Consensus and will work to implement its outcomes, including through the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which is our whole-of-nation blueprint aligned  with the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
