#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Budget Meals in Hawker Centres by Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment  

**Ms Mariam Jaafar:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in light of the continued rise in food prices at hawker centres (a) what proportion of meals sold at a hawker stall are budget meals; and (b) whether there has been feedback from hawkers that the budget meals are increasingly difficult to sustain.  

**Answer:**  

1	While the National Environment Agency (NEA) does not regulate prices of cooked food sold at hawker centres, it aims to provide hawkers with a conducive environment to set affordable food prices. Thus far, despite rising costs, affordable meal options remain available at our hawker centres, including those managed by NEA and Town Councils, as well as Socially-conscious Enterprises, where the operators are required to keep food affordable and have done so by ensuring at least one budget meal option per stall.
