#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Hawker Centre Rents by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
 
**Mr Leong Mun Wai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment for each year since 2010 (a) what is the number and percentage of hawkers who are paying market and subsidised rents respectively; and (b) what is their respective median monthly rent. 
 
**Answer:**
 
1	Currently, there are over 6,000 cooked food stalls in the 114 hawker centres owned by the Government. Over the last 10 years, the percentage of stallholders paying subsidised rent has decreased, from about 40% to about 30%, as the pioneer group of hawkers gradually retired and new hawkers joined the trade. 

2	Cooked food stallholders on the subsidised rental scheme typically pay either $192, $320, or $384 per month, depending on the scope of upgrading works that were carried out during the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme at the respective hawker centres where they are located. The median rent for non-subsidised cooked food stallholders has remained relatively stable at around $1,250 per month over the last 10 years.
