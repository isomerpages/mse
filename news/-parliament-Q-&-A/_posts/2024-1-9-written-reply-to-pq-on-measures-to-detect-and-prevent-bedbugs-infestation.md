#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on measures to detect and prevent bedbugs infestation by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Joan Pereira:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of the global resurgence of bedbug infestations, what measures are in place to detect and prevent travellers from transmitting such infestations upon their arrivals in Singapore.  

**Answer:**  

1 So far, NEA has not detected any upward trend in reports regarding bedbug infestation in Singapore. Nevertheless, it is important for businesses and residents in Singapore to exercise vigilance.  

2 While bed bugs are not known to transmit diseases to humans, they can cause discomfort, itching and allergic reactions in some people. Travellers returning to Singapore should exercise caution and personal responsibility to ensure that bed bugs are not inadvertently brought back into their work and living environments here.  

3 In addition, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has issued advisories to organisations such as the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Changi Airport Group, the Singapore Tourism Board and the Singapore Hotel Association to provide guidance on what they can do to prevent an infestation of bed bugs in premises under their purview. This includes performing thorough checks and cleaning of areas where infestations could occur, such as beds, furniture and areas where luggage are placed, transported or stored. Premises owners are also encouraged to engage professional pest control operators to eradicate bed bug infestations, should they occur.
