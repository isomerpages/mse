#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Extreme Weather Conditions by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Dr Syed Harun Alhabsyi:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of the island-wide damage to property and environment caused by the Sumatra squall on 17 September 2024 (a) whether the Ministry will consider having precautionary warning systems or measures to educate the public in cases of such extreme weather conditions; and (b) what are the lessons from the recovery and clean-up operations that can better prepare Singaporeâ€™s infrastructure for such storms in future.  

**Answer:**

1 The Singapore Government is learning from the experience of the Sumatra squall on 17 September 2024, and reviewing our practices and responses in preparation for more of such extreme weather events in future.

2 First, in forecasting and providing early warning. While the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) can currently track the development of such squalls, MSS will invest more in forecasting their intensities and providing earlier warning to the public. MSS will also increase public education on early warning systems, in preparation for more adverse weather scenarios in future.

3 Second, to ensure the structural safety and resilience of buildings in Singapore against strong winds, the existing regulatory requirements for the design, installation and inspection of exterior features of buildings have taken into account the impact of wind forces. NParks also has in place a comprehensive tree management regime that enhances the resilience of its tree population against intense rains and winds. The Government will continue to update our regulations and practices where needed, and strengthen our climate adaptation policies to ensure that Singapore remains resilient and prepared for such extreme weather events, as they become more prevalent in the face of climate change.
