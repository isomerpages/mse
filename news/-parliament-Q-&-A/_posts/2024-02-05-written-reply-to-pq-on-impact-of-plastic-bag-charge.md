#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on impact of plastic bag charge by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Rachel Ong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether a survey has been conducted on the impact of the charging for plastic bags at supermarkets in terms of how households bag their trash; (b) whether there has there been an increase in the purchase of plastic garbage bags since the implementation of charges for such plastic bags; (c) if not currently tracked, whether this can be done; and (d) what is being done to support and educate households to reduce the use of plastic bags for bagging trash and its alternatives.

**Answer:**  

1 Since the implementation of the mandatory disposable carrier bag charge on 3 July 2023, our public waste collectors have not observed any changes in households’ waste disposal habits. Households have continued to bag their waste before throwing it down the rubbish chutes.

2 We do not track the sales of trash bags. The National Environment Agency (NEA) will monitor households’ waste disposal habits and review the impact of the disposable carrier bag charge after a full year of implementation.
