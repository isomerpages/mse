#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Using Smart Water Meters to Monitor Safety of Seniors Living Alone by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Question:**

**Miss Rachel Ong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether there are plans to leverage the smart water meter being installed by SP Group to make available monitoring and push alert services to caregivers of seniors living alone when there are anomalies in home usage.

**Answer:**

1 PUB, Singaporeâ€™s National Water Agency, is currently rolling out Phase 1 of the Smart Water Meter (SWM) Programme, which would see some 300,000 premises fitted with the SWM by 2024.
   
2 The SWM Programme enables PUB to better manage water demand and customers to better track and manage their water usage. Households on the SWM programme will have access to their daily and hourly water consumption data through the _MySmartWaterMeter_ customer portal, which provides residents with suspected leak alerts and their water consumption patterns.
   
3 Currently, there are no plans to use the SWM to monitor seniors and provide alerts to caregivers of seniors. PUB will review the findings of the SWM Programme at the end of Phase 1, before considering other applications.
