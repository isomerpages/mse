#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Green Procurement by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what are the criteria that the Government uses to evaluate environmental sustainability considerations in the tender evaluation process for tenders involving (i) large constructions and (ii) information and communications technology (ICT), respectively.

**Answer:**

1 Government Procurement Entities (GPEs) have adopted evaluation criteria to differentiate solutions or suppliers that are more environmentally sustainable.  

2 For large construction tenders, the criteria include suppliers’ climate-related disclosures, level or extent of decarbonisation practices in intended construction work processes, and relevant certifications to demonstrate that the supplier is environmentally sustainable.  

3 For ICT hardware tenders, the evaluation criteria include suppliers’ climate-related disclosures, environmental sustainability certifications for supplied products, and level or extent of sustainable packaging utilised.
