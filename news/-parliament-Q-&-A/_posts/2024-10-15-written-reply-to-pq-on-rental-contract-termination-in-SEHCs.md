#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Rental Contract Termination in Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres (SEHCs) by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Leong Mun Wai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) in each year of the past five years, what percentage of hawker stalls in (i) NEA-operated hawker centres and (ii) Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres have terminated their rental contracts early; and (b) what are the main reasons for the early termination.

**Answer:**

1 From 2019 to 2023, the average annual early termination rate for cooked food stalls at NEA-managed hawker centres and Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres (SEHCs) were 3% and 8% respectively. The most common reason cited by stallholders for termination is poor business at their stalls.
