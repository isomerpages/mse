#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Disposable Plastic Bag Charge by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether there are any plans to introduce pricing guidelines for amounts that merchants may levy for the plastic bag charge.  

**Answer:**

1 Supermarket operators with an annual turnover of more than $100 million are required to charge a minimum of 5 cents per disposable carrier bag, regardless of material and size, provided at their supermarket outlets.  
  
2 For all other retailers, charging for disposable carrier bags is a business decision. There are currently no plans for the government to introduce pricing guidelines for these retailers.
