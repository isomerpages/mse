#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Table Littering Enforcement by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether an update can be provided on how many formal enforcement actions, including written warnings, have been issued since the 1 June 2023 stricter rules on tray return at hawker centres, food courts and coffee shops; and (b) whether data is available on how many such warnings have been issued to persons at or above the age of (i) 70 years (ii) 80 years and (iii) 90 years respectively.

**Answer:**

1 Since 1 June 2023, the National Environment Agency and the Singapore Food Agency have stepped up enforcement against table littering at hawker centres, coffeeshops and food courts. As at 19 June 2023, 112 written warnings have been issued, of which 9 were issued to able-bodied individuals at or above the age of 70. No fines have been issued to date.

2 Elderly patrons who are physically able to return their used trays and crockery should do so. Enforcement action will not be taken against persons who have genuine difficulties returning their trays due to frailty or physical disability. We encourage their accompanying family members or caregivers to return the used trays and crockery on their behalf. If they are dining alone and no assistance is available, cleaners will help to clear the trays and crockery left behind by them.
