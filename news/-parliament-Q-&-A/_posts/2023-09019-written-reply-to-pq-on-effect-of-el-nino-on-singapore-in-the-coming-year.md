#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on the Effect of El Nino on Singapore in the Coming Year by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
 
**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song:**  To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how will the El Nino weather pattern affect Singapore in the coming year; and (b) whether preparations are being made for a dryer Singapore weather, including its effect on water supply from both the local catchment and imported water.
 
**Answer:**
 
1	El Niño conditions are now here and will likely bring drier and warmer weather to Singapore in the next one to two months. The El Niño is expected to last till at least early next year, with the warmest temperatures potentially from March to April 2024. 

2	To safeguard water security, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) has diversified Singapore’s water supply strategy through the Four National Taps: local catchment water, imported water, NEWater, and desalinated water. While drier and warmer weather may impact our water supply from local catchment and imported water, NEWater and desalinated water are weather-resilient sources. PUB has invested and will continue investing for the long term to strengthen our water security and drought resilience amidst the effects of climate change. 

3	All of us have a role to play in managing water demand. By using water wisely, everyone can contribute to the sustainability of our water resource.
