#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Compensation to Stallholders for Hawker Centre and Market Closure by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the amount of compensation provided to hawkers and market stallholders for MSE-owned and HDB-owned hawker centres and markets in the event of closures due to repairs and redecoration or renovation works; and (b) what is the basis for the determination of such compensation.
 
**Answer:**
 
1 Hawker centres and markets typically undergo cyclical Repairs and Redecoration (R&R) every 6 to 8 years. During R&R, the centre would usually be closed for two to three months. Affected stallholders are informed in advance about the R&R and are granted rental remission for the duration of the closure. Service and conservancy charges are also typically waived during the closure. The National Environment Agency will assist interested stallholders if they wish to apply for temporary stalls in other hawker centres during this period.
