#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on standardising date-labels for food by Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the  Environment whether the Ministry will consider updating and standardising  "use by" and "best before" date-labels for food to reduce confusion over  whether food needs to be disposed of for safety reasons and hence reduce food  waste due to the confusion.

**Answer:**

1 Both “Use by” and “Best Before” are internationally accepted terms  under the Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods, and  commonly used by food manufacturers locally and overseas. The Codex is the international food standards body established by the Food and Agriculture  Organisation of the United Nations and the World Health Organisation. 

2 Standardising the use of date-marks to a specific term will require the  industry to tailor their packaging to the Singapore market, adding to  compliance burden. This may result in additional packaging costs which the  industry pass on to consumers. Given the small size of the Singapore market,  overseas food manufacturers may also choose not to change their packaging to  meet Singapore’s requirements. This could inadvertently reduce our food  import sources.

3 Under the current Food Regulations, "Use by" and "Best Before" are  both used to indicate the expiry date on food products, beyond which the food  product is not permitted to be sold in Singapore due to possible deterioration  in food quality.
