#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on safety of food delivered in extreme weather conditions by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms See Jinli Jean:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what are the measures taken by the Singapore Food Agency vis-Ã -vis local cooked food retail establishments, supermarkets, food e-commerce sellers and delivery platform operators to assure Singaporeans that the delivered food items are safe for consumption in view of extreme weather conditions extending the time taken for delivery and hotter weather.

**Answer:**

1 Under the Sale of Food Act and Environmental Public Health Act, food businesses and delivery platform operators are responsible for ensuring that the food they deliver is transported in a manner that does not compromise food safety.

2 In addition, all food delivery service providers are encouraged to adopt the Singapore Standard (SS) 672: 2021 Guidelines on delivery of ready-to-eat food, which include recommendations on ensuring that food items are maintained at the correct temperatures during transport. Consumers can also do their part by checking and storing the food
products under proper conditions upon receipt of their delivery.
