#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on the Zika Update by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether an update can be provided on the current Zika situation; and (b) whether Project Wolbachia has potential to be used to combat Zika, alongside dengue.

**Answer:**

1 As at 30 Jun 2023, 22 Zika cases have been reported in Singapore this year. 15 cases were in the cluster at Kovan which has closed and is currently under surveillance, and the remaining 7 cases were isolated cases. NEA is monitoring the situation closely and will continue to work with grassroots leaders on outreach efforts in and around the localities where Zika cases were reported.    

2 As the Zika virus is transmitted primarily by the same Aedes aegypti mosquito as dengue, Project Wolbachia, which suppresses the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population in the community over time, has the potential to reduce the risk of Zika outbreaks as well. 

3 Project Wolbachia is intended to complement, and not replace good housekeeping and basic preventive actions that prevent mosquito breeding. We are currently in the midst of the dengue season.  I urge all residents to ensure that their homes and surroundings are free of stagnant water, and to take precautions if residing in dengue cluster areas, such as spraying insecticides in dark corners, applying insect repellent and wearing long-sleeves and pants.
