#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on likelihood of surge in Dengue cases by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
 
**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:**  To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the likelihood of a surge in dengue cases in the coming months; and (b) whether the Ministry is working closely with the Ministry of Health to ensure sufficient hospital bed capacity for severe dengue cases.

**Answer:**

The number of dengue cases remains high, and the risk of a surge of cases persists. While the end of the year typically sees cooler weather and lower dengue incidence, the expected warmer than usual year-end weather due to the current El Nino phenomenon and wetter conditions in the coming weeks may create more favourable conditions for mosquito breeding and dengue transmission.

2 The National Environment Agency works closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other government agencies through the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force to monitor and manage the dengue situation. While most dengue cases can be managed by General Practitioners and polyclinics, MOH ensures that hospitals have adequate capacity to provide timely medical care for dengue patients who need it, including severe cases which require hospitalization.

3 I urge members of the public and all other stakeholders to take immediate actions to prevent mosquito breeding in order to prevent a surge in dengue cases in the coming months.
