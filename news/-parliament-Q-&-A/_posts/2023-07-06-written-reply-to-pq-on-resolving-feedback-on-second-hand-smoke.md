#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Vehicular Noise by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment how does the Ministry follow up on feedback concerning secondhand smoke at homes to ensure that the issues are resolved other than noting there is no repeat feedback from the same informer.

**Answer:**

1 To assist residents affected by second-hand tobacco smoke from neighbours smoking in their homes, the National Environment Agency, Housing & Development Board, Health Promotion Board or the relevant Town Council would jointly issue an advisory to surrounding residential units to advise smokers to be considerate to their neighbours. Based on NEAâ€™s records of feedback on smoking in homes from 2018 to 2022, most of the feedback cases did not recur after advisories had been issued. If the issue remains unresolved, the relevant agency or Town Council may engage residents in person, to advise smokers to exercise consideration and avoid smoking at windows and balconies. Affected residents can also seek help from the Community Mediation Centre for mediation to resolve the issue. If the situation persists, they can file a claim with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal.
