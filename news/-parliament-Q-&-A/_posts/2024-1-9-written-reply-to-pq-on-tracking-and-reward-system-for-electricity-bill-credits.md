#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on tracking and reward system for electricity bill credits by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms See Jinli Jean:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry can consider introducing an innovative tracking and reward system that will grant credits on the household electricity bill to residents who are recorded by the system as being consistent and active in responsible recycling.  

**Answer:**

1 I thank the Member for the suggestion. My Ministry will continue to implement initiatives that cultivate recycling habits in households. This includes the upcoming Beverage Container Return Scheme, which will encourage the recycling of plastic and metal beverage containers by providing a deposit refund when empty beverage containers are returned at designated return points.  

2 We have no plans to grant credits on the household electricity bill to residents who recycle right. It could be technically challenging to implement and sustain a system that accurately tracks and rewards the practice of recycling right by households. Nonetheless, we are supportive of the various ground-up efforts that offer incentives to nudge households towards recycling right, such as SG Recycle’s paper recycling machines, ALBA’s STEP UP mobile application and Cash-for-Trash recycling stations by Public Waste Collectors.
