#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Regulating the Use of Glue Traps by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider regulating the use of glue traps and having measures in place to ensure that cats and wild animals such as birds are not caught in such traps.

**Answer:**

1 Glue traps are an effective tool for trapping and removing rats when used responsibly and safely. The then-Agri-food and Veterinary Authority, in consultation with the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Singapore Pest Management Association (SPMA), had issued guidelines to Pest Control Operators (PCOs) on the responsible use of glue traps. These include proper placement, limiting the sizes of traps and the appropriate response time for PCOs to attend to trapped animals.

2 The National Parks Board (NParks), NEA and SPMA are currently reviewing the guidelines in consultation with animal welfare groups to reduce the likelihood of non-target animals being trapped and to render quicker assistance should they be accidentally trapped. When ready, the revised guidelines will be issued to the PCOs and published online.
