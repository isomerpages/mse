#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on makeshift smoking corners by Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment
 
**Question:**

**Mr Yip Hon Weng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether NEA has conducted any studies or assessments to estimate the potential increase in makeshift smoking corners due to the phase-out of designated smoking areas; and (b) whether there will be any collaborative efforts by NEA with coffeeshop owners and other stakeholders to move these makeshift smoking corners away from public areas with high footfalls.

**Answer:**

1 To limit the exposure of second-hand tobacco smoke to non-smokers, the National Environment Agency has stopped accepting applications for new smoking corners in coffeeshops since June 2017. The number of smoking corners in coffeeshops has been gradually decreasing over time.

2 As mentioned previously in the House, makeshift smoking points are not prohibited unless they are located in places specified in the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Regulations 2018. Nevertheless, premises owners are urged to be considerate and ensure that makeshift smoking points in areas they manage do not cause disamenities to the public. While NEA does not have plans to conduct any studies or assessments, we will look into feedback on any disamenities caused by makeshift smoking points and, where substantiated, we will engage the relevant stakeholders on possible mitigating measures, including removing or relocating the smoking points.
