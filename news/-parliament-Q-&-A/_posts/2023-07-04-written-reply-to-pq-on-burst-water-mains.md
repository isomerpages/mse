#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Burst Water Mains by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to burst water mains under PUB jurisdiction, what are the support and redress available to members of the public, including residents whose homes and personal property are affected.

**Answer:**

1 In the event of a leak in PUB’s pipe network, PUB will quickly isolate the leak and carry out repairs. Customers experiencing a disruption in water supply will be informed, and PUB will provide immediate support such as water wagons and water bags. The vast majority of such water pipe leaks do not affect residents’ homes. Where it does, PUB will investigate and provide additional assistance on a case-by-case basis.
