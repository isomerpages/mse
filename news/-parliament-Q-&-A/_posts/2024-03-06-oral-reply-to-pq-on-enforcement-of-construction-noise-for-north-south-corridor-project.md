#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Enforcement of Construction Noise for North-South Corridor Project by Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Yip Hon Weng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment for the North-South Corridor construction project along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 (a) how many errant contractors were fined in 2023 for noise related infractions; (b) what are the penalties for recalcitrant offenders; and (c) what measures is the Ministry taking to minimize noise related issues from the project.

**Answer:**

1  In 2023, the National Environment Agency (NEA) took 1 enforcement action against the contractor of the North South Corridor construction site located along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 for noise related infractions. Contractors are permitted to carry out safety critical work at nights and/or on weekends as such works have to be conducted continuously for safety reasons. However, these contractors must still implement all practicable noise mitigation measures to minimise noise.   

2  For this construction project, NEA required the contractor to conduct a noise impact assessment and implement a noise management plan to mitigate noise. To minimise inconveniences to stakeholders, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and its contractors deploy noise barriers, noise enclosures, and fit mufflers on machinery to reduce noise levels. LTA also conducts localised stakeholder engagement and works with grassroots leaders to inform and update the public on project-specific information.
