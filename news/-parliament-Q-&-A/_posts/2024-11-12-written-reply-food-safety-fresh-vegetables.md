#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Food Safety of Fresh Vegetables Served
 
**Mr Liang Eng Hwa:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how does the Ministry carry out surveillance on fresh vegetables served in food outlets for potential bacterial contamination such as E. coli; and (b) whether the current food safety regime and standards with regard to serving fresh vegetables are adequate.

**Answer:**
 
1 â€‹SFA inspects and tests both imported and locally produced vegetables, to ensure compliance with food safety requirements, including standards for microbiological and chemical contamination. These standards are periodically reviewed to align with Codex, the international food standards body established by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and the World Health Organisation. Where standards are not prescribed in the Codex, SFA will take reference from standards adopted by major developed countries.

2 SFA also conducts inspections on licensed food businesses and samples food to test for microbiological and chemical contaminations, including pathogens. Food businesses of higher regulatory concern, such as those with records of past infringements, are subject to stepped up surveillance.
