#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on hemical Recycling of Plastic Waste by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis: To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment how is the Government supporting agri-tech start-ups and other SMEs that focus on growing food locally.

**Answer**:

1 As part of our efforts to develop a circular economy and reduce our emissions, the government is working with industry to explore chemical recycling of plastic waste as a complementary approach to mechanical recycling. Chemical recycling enables Singapore to expand our capabilities to treat plastics which are not suitable for mechanical recycling, such as contaminated packaging and single-use plastics.

2 In October 2020, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and Shell launched a joint study on the feasibility of chemically recycling plastic waste in Singapore. Findings from the study indicated that chemical recycling in Singapore is technically feasible. In January 2021, NEA launched a feasibility study for a pilot Plastic Recovery Facility to recover plastic waste from domestic waste for chemical recycling. NEA is currently analysing the findings of the two studies before deciding on our next steps.

3 We remain open and committed to work with interested stakeholders in the ecosystem to close the plastic waste loop locally, diversify petrochemical feedstock towards sustainable sources, and reduce national carbon emissions.
