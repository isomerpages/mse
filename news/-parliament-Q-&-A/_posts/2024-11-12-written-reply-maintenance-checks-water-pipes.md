#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Maintenance Checks on Water Pipes

**Mr Ong Hua Han:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability (a) how often are maintenance checks conducted on water pipes in public housing flats, especially for older buildings; (b) how and how often does PUB conduct sampling and monitoring of tap water in public housing flats to ensure its quality and cleanliness; and (c) how often does PUB receive complaints or feedback about water quality.

**Answer:**

1 Maintenance of water pipes in HDB estates is a shared responsibility between national water agency PUB, Town Councils and homeowners.

2 PUB continually monitors its network of potable water pipes with sensors. PUB also conducts yearly leak detection checks on its network of pipes, with more frequent inspections for pipes located near construction activities and those that had previously experienced leaks. In addition, PUB has a pipe replacement programme based on an assessment of the condition of the pipes, to minimise leaks and ensure a reliable water supply around the clock.

3 Town Councils are responsible for the maintenance of water storage tanks and water pipes on the common property of public housing estates. The water storage tanks must be inspected, cleaned and disinfected annually by a licensed plumber to ensure that they meet safety and hygiene standards. Homeowners are responsible for the maintenance of pipes and fittings of individual units and are advised to engage licensed plumbers for the maintenance of these pipes and fittings when necessary.

4 All water produced by our plants is tested daily to ensure that it meets our stringent water quality requirements before being supplied to customers. The daily tests include samples collected from across the water distribution network including household taps. The quality of our tap water complies with the standards stipulated in the Environmental Public Health (Water Suitable for Drinking) Regulations and is well above the World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines for drinking water quality. Singaporeâ€™s tap water is perfectly safe for drinking directly from the tap without any further filtering or treatment.

5 On average in 2023, PUB received about four cases of feedback per day pertaining to tap water quality and PUB responds to every case promptly with laboratory testing to confirm that the water is safe for consumption.
