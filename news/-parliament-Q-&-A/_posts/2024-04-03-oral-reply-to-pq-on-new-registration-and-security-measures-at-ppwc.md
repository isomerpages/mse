#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on New Registration and Security Measures at the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre by Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how does the Singapore Food Agency intend to mitigate vehicular congestion that may arise from the new registration and security measures at the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre (PPWC); and (b) whether aspects of this system will be reviewed to take into account the feedback from PPWC vendors and consumers.

**Answer:**

1 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is implementing a phased roll-out of the new Visitor Management System (VMS) at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre (PPWC). As the PPWC is an important node in our food supply chain, the VMS aims to enhance safety and security on the premises and facilitate contract tracing and site management in the event of emergencies and pandemics. The system is being implemented in phases beginning with PPWC-based operators in March 2024 to allow them time to adapt.

2 To facilitate a smooth transition, SFA has been engaging the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre Association and stallholders, made trial VMS kiosks available at PPWC and conducted user demonstration practice sessions. As the various phases are implemented, SFA will review the operation of the system and take into account relevant feedback from stakeholders to strike a balance between the security and operational interests of PPWC, stallholders and the public.
