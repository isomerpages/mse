#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Reverse Vending Machines by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Yip Hon Weng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the
Environment (a) whether the Ministry can provide data on the amount of
recycling achieved since the launch of the Reverse Vending Machines (RVM)
scheme under Recycle N Save, a joint initiative by F&N and NEA to place 50
Smart RVMs across Singapore to encourage recycling of used drink bottles and
cans; and (b) following the discontinuation of Recycle N Save rewards on 31
July 2023, whether the RVMs are still being adequately maintained to continue
the recycling of beverage containers.

**Answer:**  

1 Under Recycle N Save, a joint initiative by the National Environment
Agency (NEA) and F&N Foods Pte Ltd (F&N), 50 Reverse Vending Machines
(RVMs) were placed at public locations and in schools across the island, to
encourage Singaporeans to adopt an eco-conscious lifestyle by offering them a
convenient way to recycle. Since its launch in October 2019, more than 16
million drink containers have been collected.

2 Following the cessation of the Recycle N Save rewards on 31 July 2023,
the RVMs remain accessible at various locations, such as at partnering malls
and sports centres, where the drink containers are collected by the location
partners. F&N also continues to provide regular maintenance for the RVMs, to
ensure that they remain in good working condition.

3 When the Beverage Container Return Scheme commences in 2026,
consumers will be able to return empty beverage containers at conveniently
located designated return points and claim a full refund of the deposit.
