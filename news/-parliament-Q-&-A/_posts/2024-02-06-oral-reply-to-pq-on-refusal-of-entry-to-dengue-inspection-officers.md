#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on refusal of entry to dengue inspection officers by Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the  Environment (a) how many cases of refusal of entry to the National Environment  Agency’s (NEA) dengue inspection officers have been reported in the past three  years; and (b) whether the Ministry has any plans to increase the penalties for  individuals who refuse entry to NEA’s dengue inspection officers for inspection  under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act. 

**Answer:**

1 Most residents allow the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) officers  to inspect their premises after the officers explain the need to conduct checks for  mosquito breeding and stem dengue transmission. In the past three years, NEA  has encountered about 6 instances of refused entry for every 100 inspection  attempts at residential premises. In such instances, NEA would offer to  reschedule the inspection to another time. Eventually, most of them will comply  and facilitate our inspections. 

2 Under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act 1998 (CVPA), notices to  require residents to make their premises available for inspection may be served  to those who repeatedly refuse entry to NEA inspection officers. Individuals who fail to comply with the notice can be charged under Section 45 of the CVPA for  obstructing or hindering NEA officers from performing their duties. Offenders  are liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both. We have not had the need to charge  anyone under Section 45 for repeated refusal to entry in the past three years and  we do not have any plans to increase the penalties at this time.  

3 In light of the increasing number of dengue cases, I urge all individuals and  premises managers to take urgent action to break the disease transmission by  adopting good housekeeping habits to prevent mosquito breeding.
