#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on extension of lifespan of Semakau Landfill by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment  

**Dr Wan Rizal:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of concerns that Semakau landfill is nearing its capacity limits, what measures is the Government taking to enhance waste reduction and recycling efforts, particularly in terms of repurposing incineration ash for construction or land reclamation as studied by local universities.  

**Answer:**  

1 More than half the available space on Semakau Landfill has been filled and it is expected to run out of space by 2035 at current waste disposal rates. As indicated in MSEâ€™s replies to recent parliamentary questions, there are on-going efforts to extend the lifespan of the landfill well beyond 2035, including regulatory measures on key waste streams, as well as research and development into repurposing of waste residues such as incineration ash.  

2 For example, the National Environment Agency is working with the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore, the National University of Singapore and other partners, to study the feasibility of recovering and processing landfilled incineration ash and other non-incinerable wastes from Semakau Landfill as alternative reclamation fill material for use at Tuas Port Phase 3. Preliminary indications on its feasibility are expected in the coming months. If successful, this project will help to extend the lifespan of Semakau Landfill.  

3 Notwithstanding these efforts, we need to press on towards achieving our Zero Waste vision by moving upstream to each do our part to reduce waste and recycle right.
