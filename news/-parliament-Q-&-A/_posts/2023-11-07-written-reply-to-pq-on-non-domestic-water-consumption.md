#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on non-domestic water consumption by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Leong Mun Wai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the current proportion of non-domestic water consumers who consume (i) potable water (ii) more than 40 cubic metres of potable water per month and (iii) non-potable water, such as NEWater and industrial water; and (b) in 2022, what is the total consumption of potable and non-potable water per day by non-domestic waterconsumers.

**Answer:**

Non-domestic water users refer to those beyond households, and comprise various industries, commercial buildings, schools, community centres, and so on. In 2022, the total consumption of potable and non-potable water by non-domestic water users is around 360 million cubic meters, which is about half of Singapore's total water consumption. Potable water constitutes about half of the water consumed by non-domestic water users, with the remaining half of water needs met by NEWater and industrial water.

2 About 25% of non-domestic water users consume more than 40 cubic metres of potable water per month. This is dependent on the scale of their operations, and reflects the nature of their businesses, such as food establishments and manufacturing.
