#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Improving Recycling Outcomes by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms See Jinli Jean:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the
Environment (a) what are the Ministryâ€™s plans to improve recycling outcomes of
plastic packaging; and (b) whether the Ministry will require food and beverage
merchants to (i) educate consumers on what and how to recycle disposables
correctly to avoid contamination of clean recyclables in the recycling bin and (ii)
commit to clear timelines for the replacement of disposable plastic packaging
with sustainable and affordable alternatives.

**Answer:** 

1 Packaging waste, including plastics, is a priority waste stream under the
Zero Waste Masterplan. My Ministry and the National Environment Agency
(NEA) promote the recycling of packaging waste through regulatory measures
and educational campaigns. One such example is the upcoming beverage
container return scheme. In July 2024, NEA issued a licence to Beverage
Container Return Scheme Limited, a not-for-profit company formed by a
consortium of beverage producers comprising Coca-Cola Singapore Beverages,
F&N Foods and Pokka, to operate the beverage container return scheme from
April 2026. Under the scheme, a 10-cent deposit will be refunded to consumers
when they return their metal or plastic beverage containers for recycling.

2 NEA also carries out regular campaigns to promote good recycling habits.
As part of the Recycle Right campaign rolled out in 2019, tips are shared with business owners and consumers on how to identify, segregate and clean
recyclables so that they can be properly recycled. Resources can be downloaded
from the Clean & Green Singapore website (www.cgs.gov.sg).

3 All types of non-reusable packaging, including those made from
biodegradable materials, result in some form of environmental impact. Reducing
the use of disposable packaging, regardless of material type and promoting the
use of reusables are more sustainable approaches. To this end, NEA has been
working with partners across both the retail and F&B industries to promote
sustainable practices such as bring-your-own-bag, food container and bottle
under the Say YES to Waste Less campaign.
