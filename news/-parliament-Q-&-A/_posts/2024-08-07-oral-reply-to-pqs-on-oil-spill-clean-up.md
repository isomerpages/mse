**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether an update can be provided on the clean-up works arising from the oil spill at Pasir Panjang Terminal on 14 June 2024; and (b) whether the Ministry can share a timeline on when all affected beaches will be reopened for public use.


**Answer:**  

1  The clean-up operation is progressing well. We have completed the first phase of the clean-up The second phase of the clean-up which focuses on difficult-to-clean areas like rock bunds, breakwaters, and oil trapped deeper in the sand and is well underway. Some beaches have progressed to the final phase, where volunteers are mobilised to participate in the clean-up, and accelerate the re-opening of the beaches.

2  Our beaches will be re-opened as clean-up operations are completed. As of today, Siloso Beach at Sentosa has re-opened for all water activities. Several parts of East Coast Park have re-opened for land-based activities We plan to complete the cleaning of all affected beaches within the next one month or so.
