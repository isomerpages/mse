#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Using Smart Water Meters to Protecting Seniors from Dengue by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether there are targeted materials and efforts to educate and protect seniors from dengue; and (b) whether there are partnerships with healthcare institutions to conduct further screening at dengue hot spots in Singapore.

**Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) has implemented targeted dengue prevention outreach efforts aimed at educating and protecting seniors. For example, NEA works with partners such as the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Agency for Integrated Careâ€™s Silver Generation Office, social service agencies and senior activity centres to disseminate educational materials on dengue prevention and distribute insect repellent in dengue clusters.

2 Primary healthcare providers play a crucial role in the management of dengue patients. Doctors are reminded to be vigilant for dengue fever among individuals with compatible symptoms. In addition, NEA and MOH work together with General Practitioner (GP) clinics and polyclinics to engage individuals diagnosed or suspected to be infected with dengue, to help stop dengue transmission in the community. This year, educational materials such as posters and brochures on preventing further dengue transmission and clinical aftercare will also be made available in GP clinics and polyclinics, particularly those located in key dengue clusters.
