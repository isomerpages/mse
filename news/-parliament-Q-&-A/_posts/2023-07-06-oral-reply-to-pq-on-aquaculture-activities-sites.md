#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Sites for Aquaculture Activities by Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in identifying a site for potential aquaculture activities (a) what are the considerations by the Government; and (b) what are the procedures in place for expert and public consultation.

**Answer:**

1 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) works closely with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and other agencies to identify suitable sea space for aquaculture production. SFA conducts studies and surveys to assess the suitability of each site such as water quality, carrying capacity and presence of ecological receptors to balance between production requirements and environmental sustainability. 

2 An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is done if the intended activity is expected to have impact on the environment. The EIA process includes robust engagement with agencies, nature groups and relevant stakeholders, to review the proposed mitigating and monitoring measures. 

3	Beyond the EIA process, SFA also regularly engages with the nature groups and the academics to keep them apprised of aquaculture development plans and works closely with them to understand the effects of sea-based farming on our local marine environment.
