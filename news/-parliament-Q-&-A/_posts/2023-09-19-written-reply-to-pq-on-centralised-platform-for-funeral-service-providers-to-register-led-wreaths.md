#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Centralised Platform for Funeral Service Providers to Register LED Wreaths by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
 
**Ms Joan Pereira:**  To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider working with the industry to have a centralised platform for funeral service providers to register their LED wreaths to ensure that the number of LED wreaths delivered to each wake adheres to the guidelines.
 
**Answer:**
 
1	In June 2022, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Association of Funeral Directors Singapore co-developed and issued the guidelines on the use of light-emitting wreaths and inflatables at funeral wakes. The guidelines include a limit on the number of such wreaths per wake, where they can be placed and the hours they are allowed to be turned on. NEA had worked with stakeholders to promulgate the guidelines through the terms and conditions of permits for wakes held in public spaces. 

2	Funeral services providers have generally been compliant with the guidelines. From June 2022 to July 2023, the number of feedback received by NEA has decreased from 8 feedback per month to an average of 3 feedback per month.

3	NEA has no plans to set up a centralised platform at this time and will continue to work with relevant stakeholders to monitor the situation and to promote compliance with the guidelines.
