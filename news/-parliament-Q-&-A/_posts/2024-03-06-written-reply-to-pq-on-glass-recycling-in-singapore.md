#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on glass recycling in Singapore by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what are the reasons for the low glass recycling rate in Singapore; and (b) what measures are being taken by the Ministry to improve the glass recycling rate.

1  Glass waste comprises around 1 per cent of total waste generated in 2022, with a recycling rate of 14 per cent. The recycling rate has been low due to the high cost of glass recycling, which weakens the economic incentive for generators of glass waste.

2  The entry of new recycling companies in Singapore and increasing awareness on sustainability issues will help to raise the glass recycling rate. For example, Abraclean, a glass recycling company which started operations in 2022, started processing recycled glass abrasives into ship blasting materials. NEAâ€™s Recycle Right Campaign also raises awareness on how glass can be recycled properly.

3  We are exploring the feasibility of expanding the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) approach to manage other packaging waste types, including glass containers.
