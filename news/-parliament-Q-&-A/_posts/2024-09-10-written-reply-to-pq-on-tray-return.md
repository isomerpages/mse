#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Tray Return by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and
the Environment (a) what criteria are used by National Environment Agency
(NEA) officers to determine if an elderly or disabled person is unable to return
their tray at hawker centres; (b) whether all NEA officers and tray return
ambassadors are briefed on these criteria so they do not advise or issue
summonses to such persons for not returning their trays; and (c) whether notices
in hawker centres can make clear that such persons are not obligated to return
their trays.

**Answer:**  

1 The National Environment Agency does not take enforcement action
against persons who have genuine difficulties returning their trays due to frailty
or physical disability. This is a pragmatic approach in view of the difficulties
they may face.

2 All relevant officers have been briefed on the enforcement approach for
table littering and will exercise the necessary discretion based on their
observations on site.
