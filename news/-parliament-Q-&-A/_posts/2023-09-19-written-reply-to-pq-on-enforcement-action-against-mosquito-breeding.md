#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Enforcement Action Against Mosquito Breeding by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
 
**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) in 2023 to date, what is the number of cases of mosquito breeding against which NEA has taken enforcement action; (b) how does the trend compare against the past three years; and (c) whether more NEA enforcement officers will be deployed at current dengue hotspots to help close the dengue clusters. 
 
**Answer:**
 
1	 The number of enforcement actions taken differs from year to year, depending on the overall dengue situation. From the start of this year, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has taken enforcement actions in about 5,200 cases against premises owners for mosquito breeding. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, enforcement actions were taken against premises owners for mosquito breeding in approximately 14,700, 11,300 and 15,900 cases respectively.

2	NEA has increased inspection and mitigation efforts at dengue hotspots, and will continue its dynamic deployment of vector control resources to close dengue clusters as quickly as possible. However, NEAâ€™s measures need to be complemented by individual and collective community actions to prevent mosquito breeding and reduce the Aedes mosquito population.
