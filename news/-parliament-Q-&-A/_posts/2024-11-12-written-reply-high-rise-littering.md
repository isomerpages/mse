#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on High-Rise Littering
 
**Mr Liang Eng Hwa:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how many individuals have been caught engaging in high-rise littering through the deployment of surveillance cameras in 2024; and (b) whether NEA considers other types of evidence, including eyewitness accounts, when carrying out enforcement actions.
 
**Answer:**
 
1 From January to October 2024, about 800 acts of high-rise littering from more than 400 residential units were captured by surveillance cameras deployed by the National Environment Agency (NEA). Of these, NEA has concluded investigations and taken action for more than 150 cases. The remaining cases are still under investigation.
 
2 NEA and Town Councils share information when investigating high-rise littering offences. If there are eyewitness accounts, NEA will conduct investigations, including interviews with relevant parties, to collect evidence. Members of the public may also submit video evidence of high-rise littering acts to NEA for investigation.
