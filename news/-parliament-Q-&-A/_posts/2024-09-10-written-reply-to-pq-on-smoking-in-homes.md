#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Smoking in Homes by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability
and the Environment whether the Ministry will amend the law to clarify if the
exhalation of cigarette smoke to the open air outside of a HDB flat is a violation
of the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Regulations when the individual
is smoking within the flat; and (b) if not, why not.

**Answer:**  

1 The exhalation of cigarette smoke to the open air outside of a HDB flat is
not a violation of the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Regulations when
the individual is smoking within the flat, as smoking is not prohibited in
residential homes.

2 Nevertheless, we urge residents to be considerate of others, even when
smoking within their own homes.
