#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Food Consumption Data by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) collects data on consumption rate of food items that are not included in SFA’s annual reports or the Singapore Food Statistics; (b) if so, what are these food items or categories of food items; and (c) if not, why are they not tracked.

**Answer:**

1 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA)’s Annual Report and Singapore Food Statistics track the consumption of commonly consumed food items, which are hen shell eggs, chicken, pork, beef, mutton, seafood, vegetables and fruits. Such data inform our food resilience strategies. SFA does not track the consumption rate of other food items, which do not have significant impact on our food resilience.
