#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on average annual operating cost for hawker centre by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment over the past five years and across the 119 markets and hawker centres managed by NEA, what is the average annual operating cost associated with running a hawker centre. 

**Answer:**  

1 The cost of operating each hawker centre varies, based on factors such as the size of the centre. There are also expenses that are incurred periodically, such as for painting, repair and renovation. A significant part of the costs is funded from the Service and Conservancy Charge (S&CC) and table cleaning fees collected. For a typical centre with about 50 cooked food stalls and 80 market stalls, this amounts to about $40,000 a month, based on median S&CC and cleaning fees.
