#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Renovation Noise Complaints by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Rachel Ong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the number of noise complaints arising from renovations carried out in landed houses in the last five years; and (b) what is the average number of days taken for renovation in such houses.

**Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) received 2,260 cases of noise complaints in 2018 from renovation and construction work in landed houses, 2,199 cases in 2019, 2,311 cases in 2020, 3,851 cases in 2021 and 3,572 cases in 2022. Firm enforcement action is taken if the maximum permissible noise levels stipulated in the Environmental Protection and Management (Control of Noise at Construction Sites) Regulations are exceeded.

2 My Ministry does not collect information on the number of days taken for renovation and construction work in landed houses.
