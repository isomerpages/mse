many Singaporean households were in arrears on their utility bills in 2023 and what were 
the median and maximum number of months they were in arrears.

households had water bills in arrears for six months or more, with the median duration of 
arrears being less than one month.

2 Eligible households receive U-Save rebates from the Government to help offset their 
utility expenses. As announced at Budget 2024, eligible households will receive two-and-a-half times the amount of regular U-Save rebates, or up to $950, in Financial Year 2024.
