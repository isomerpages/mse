#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Recycling Rate by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Liang Eng Hwa:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment given that latest statistics from the NEA indicate recycling rate in Singapore has declined in 2023 (a) how can waste recycling rates be increased; and (b) how can recycling resource loops be improved.

**Answer:**  

1  The response to this question also addresses related Parliamentary Questions on efforts to promote recycling filed by Ms He Ting Ru and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim for the Sitting on or after 7 August.

2  The National Environment Agency (NEA) released the 2023 Waste and Recycling Statistics on 19 Jun 2024. The overall recycling rate remained largely steady at around 60 per cent since 2013, but experienced a sharp decline around 2020 due to COVID-19, and was at 52 per cent in 2023. A similar trend was observed for the domestic recycling rate, which hovered around 20 per cent before declining in recent years to 12 per cent in 2023. The decline in recent years is largely due to structural factors such as higher freight costs and lower demand for recycled materials due to the weaker economy following COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions as well as trade restrictions imposed by foreign countries towards recyclables. NEAâ€™s 2023 survey on household recycling showed an increase from 64 per cent in 2021 to 72 per cent in 2023 in recycling participation. Our domestic waste generated per capita and non-domestic waste

3  To continue our push for more recycling and to close the waste loop, we will redouble our efforts at recycling and resource recovery, even as we continue to encourage the generation of less waste in the first instance. Key examples include segregation and reporting requirements for food waste in large industrial and commercial food waste generators, as well as the upcoming beverage container recycling scheme. We will also continue to study and develop new ways to close our resource loops. This includes exploring the use of mixed materials from Semakau Landfill, comprising incineration ashes and other materials, as reclamation fill.

4  With new initiatives being progressively implemented to shift attitudes and behaviours to make 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) the norm for citizens and businesses, we hope to see an improvement in our overall recycling rate and reduction in waste sent to landfill.

5  Everyone has a part to play to reduce waste and recycle right, to ensure that Singapore remains clean, green and liveable. Let us collectively press on with efforts to achieve our 2030 targets for recycling rates and reduction in waste sent to landfill in our Zero Waste Masterplan.
