#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on contractors violating environmental laws by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Yip Hon Weng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment  (a) how many building contractors who violated environmental pollution laws have  been apprehended in the past three years; (b) whether routine surveillance and spot  checks are in place to monitor these contractors as they complete the construction  project; (c) what proactive measures are Government agencies implementing to  prevent environmental violations; (d) what reporting channels are available to the  public; and (e) what is the process to ensure effective follow-up and resolution. 

**Answer:**

1 Building contractors must comply with environmental pollution control measures, including regulations relating to noise and illegal discharges into waterways, as set out in the Environmental Protection and Management Act, the Environmental Public Health Act, and the Sewerage and Drainage Act. These regulations are enforced by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and PUB.  

2 From 2021 to 2023, NEA carried out 1,577 enforcement actions against building contractors for violations related to construction noise, and five enforcement actions for illegal discharge of trade effluent. In the same period, PUB took 402 enforcement actions against building contractors for improper or inadequate implementation of earth control measures (ECMs), which are required to prevent the discharge of silt into our waterways.

3 On surveillance, NEA requires contractors to install noise meters at the nearest residential or noise-sensitive premises, to monitor noise generated from their worksite and ensure compliance with the permissible noise limits. Contractors that violate the no-work rule on Sundays and public holidays are also required to install video surveillance equipment to deter further non-compliance and facilitate  enforcement. For illegal discharges into waterways, all construction sites of 0.2 hectares and above are required to install CCTVs to monitor the treated water discharge. The visual feed from the CCTVs is analysed in real-time with automatic alerts to relevant parties, including PUB, for prompt actions. PUB also conducts regular site inspections on construction sites to ensure that ECMs are properly implemented.  

4 Our agencies take proactive measures to prevent environmental violations. For larger construction projects situated near residential or noise-sensitive premises, NEA requires contractors to submit Noise Management Plans (NMP) prior to the commencement of work. Furthermore, occupiers of specified construction sites with contract sums exceeding $10 million are required to appoint an Environmental Control Officer for Specified Construction Sites [ECO(SCS)], whose role includes facilitating compliance with environmental requirements, such as managing noise  and water pollution.  

5 The Government also encourages the industry to strengthen their commitment to environmental standards through the Green and Gracious Builder Scheme (GGBS), which accredits contractors who adopt good practices to reduce their environmental impact during construction, including efforts to minimise noise and water pollution. Based on the current tendering process, construction companies must be certified under the GGBS in order to participate in public sector construction tenders with project values of $5 million and above. 

6 Members of the public that spot any potential environmental violations from construction sites may submit their feedback through the various reporting channels, including the myENV and OneService mobile applications, as well as NEA and PUBâ€™s 24-hour hotlines.
