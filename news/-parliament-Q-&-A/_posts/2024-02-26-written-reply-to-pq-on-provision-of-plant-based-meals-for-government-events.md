#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Provision of Plant-based Meals for Government Events by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Hazel Poa:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Government has considered offering plant-based meals for Government events to lead the way in making sustainability more mainstream.

**Answer:**

1 The Government is committed to take the lead in support of our nation’s sustainability agenda. Government events are key public touchpoints and have the potential to influence behaviour change. We have published a Best Practice 
Guide to advice public agencies on organising Environmentally-Friendly events. This includes encouraging the selection of caterers who have obtained the Singapore Food Agency’s Farm-to-Table (FTT) Recognition Programme or equivalent certification that take into account whether the produce is grown sustainably.

2 Depending on the composition of participants, Government events also generally feature a reasonable range of choices for different nutritional, cultural and religious requirements, including vegetarian options.
