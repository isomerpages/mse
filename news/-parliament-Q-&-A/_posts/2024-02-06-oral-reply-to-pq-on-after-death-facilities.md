#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on after death facilities by Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment
 
**Ms Carrie Tan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the  Environment (a) whether the Ministry has considered innovative ways to  process the remains of those who have passed on so as to reduce the demand  for land to build columbariums in the future; and (b) whether approaches such  as allowing ash scattering around trees and resizing of urns and niches have  been and will be considered. 

**Ms Carrie Tan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the  Environment in view of the ageing population and projected rise in death rates,  whether the Ministry will consider channelling resources towards efforts to  change the mindsets of Singaporeans and destigmatise after-death facilities and  amenities, such as through public communications and Forward SG dialogues. 

**Answer:**

1 I thank the Member of Parliament for raising the issue, which is an  important topic given our rapidly ageing population. Annual deaths in  Singapore are expected to increase from about 25,000 today to about 60,000 by the 2060s. 

2 The National Environment Agency (NEA) therefore, works closely with  land use planning agencies such as the Urban Redevelopment Authority to plan  ahead for more after-death facilities such as funeral parlours, wake halls and  columbaria to ensure adequate capacity. With an increasingly ageing population, such facilities will inevitably be a more prevalent feature of our  urban landscape. 

3 Singaporeans by and large accept the need for such facilities, which are  developed in a way that is sensitive to and integrated with the surrounding  community. For example, the Mount Vernon Funeral Parlour Complex, which  is being built, will be integrated with a nearby park and with lush greenery to  provide a visual screen.  

4 Today, most bereaved families will opt to cremate the body of their  loved ones if the deceased’s religion does not require burial, and will typically  place cremated ashes in niches. To provide more options for the public, in May  2021, NEA introduced Inland Ash Scattering (or IAS), at the Garden of Peace  in Choa Chu Kang Cemetery as an additional option for managing cremated  ashes. IAS requires less land compared to traditional niches, and the fee for IAS is also lower in comparison to niche fees.

5 Since its introduction, there has been increasing demand for IAS, with  the number of applications increasing steadily from about 900 in 2021 to about  2,000 in 2023. A second IAS facility, the Garden of Serenity, is being  constructed together with the new Mandai Crematorium Complex, which will  make IAS more accessible when it is opened in 2025. 

6 Besides IAS and niches, families can also place ashes of departed loved  ones at home or scatter them at sea. NEA will continue to study methods of  intensifying land use and design at future facilities to minimise the land  required and optimise land usage. 

7 But as the Member rightly pointed out, the acceptance of after death facilities in their neighbourhood or even some distance from where they live  vary. More can be done to improve the acceptability of after-death facilities,  and all of us – in this Chamber and beyond – can do our part.  

8 This starts with raising awareness of end-of-life planning and post-death  matters. To create awareness and make it easier for individuals to plan ahead,  My Legacy@LifeSG was launched in 2020 as a one-stop portal on end-of-life  planning and post-death matters. There are also ongoing efforts to work with  stakeholders such as the Singapore Hospice Council, to engage the public to  normalise conversations on death and dying. These conversations are  necessary, although they can sometimes be difficult. 

9 Beyond destigmatising after-death facilities and explaining why such  facilities are needed, it is also important to understand and address the concerns  that stakeholders have, especially when actual sites have been identified for development of such facilities. This way, when our loved ones pass on at some  point, we can be assured that they can be provided with a dignified sending-off  and a proper resting place.
