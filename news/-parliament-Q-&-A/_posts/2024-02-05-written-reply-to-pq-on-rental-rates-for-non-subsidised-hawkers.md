#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on rental rates for non-subsidised hawkers by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment for markets and hawker centres managed by NEA, what has been the highest and lowest monthly rents that a non-subsidised hawker has had to pay over the past five years.

**Answer:**  

1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) rents out market and cooked food stalls through a monthly tender exercise, which is a transparent and fair process, with no minimum bid amount. In the past five years, stallholders have successfully secured stalls at bids from $1 to $8,301 a month. 95% of the successful tender bids for a stall were less than $3,600 per month.

2 Regardless of the successful bid amount, the rent that these stallholders pay will be adjusted towards the assessed market rent, which is determined by independent professional valuers, after the initial three-year tenancy period. Since 2019, the median assessed market rentals for non-subsidised market and cooked food stalls have remained constant at about $320 and $1,200 a month respectively.
