#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Public Consultation on Singapore's Nationally Determined Contribution by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry intends to conduct a public consultation on Singapore’s new or updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) which outlines Singapore's efforts in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, that will be due under the Paris Agreement in 2025; and (b) whether this will be done in time for the submission of the updated NDC at least 9 to 12 months in advance of the relevant Conference of Parties.

**Answer:**

1 Singapore is committed to fulfilling our international obligations under the Paris Agreement to contribute to global climate action.

2 After submitting our initial 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, in 2019, we recently raised our climate ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 in October 2022. We also pledged to reduce emissions to around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030 after peaking emissions earlier. Agencies are working towards these targets.

3 The Government is concurrently developing Singapore’s 2035 NDC, including plans to consult stakeholders.
