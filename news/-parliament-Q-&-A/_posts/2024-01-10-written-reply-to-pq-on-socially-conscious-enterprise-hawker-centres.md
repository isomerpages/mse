#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on socially conscious enterprise hawker centres by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment how has the Ministry assessed the impact of cost increases experienced by hawkers on the prices of affordable food options at hawker centres operated by Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres.  

**Answer:**  

1 Operators of Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres (SEHCs) have committed that all stalls will provide at least one affordable meal option as part of their tender commitment. Hawkers have the flexibility to price other food items. Typically, they would do so taking into consideration various factors, such as market competition, operating costs, location, and patron demographics.  

2 SEHC operators may propose adjustments to the price of affordable meal options, subject to NEAâ€™s approval. NEA will review whether the proposed increase is reasonable.
