#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on reported cases of catered food for foreign workers without timestamp by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment for each year in the past five years, how many cases have been reported where catered food for migrant workers living in dormitories are provided without a time-stamp indicating the date and time by which the food should be consumed.

**Answer:**

In the past five years, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has not received any reported cases of catered food for migrant workers living in dormitories being provided without a time-stamp to indicate the date and time by which the food should be consumed.
