#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on National Action Strategy on Marine Litter by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether she can provide an update on the progress made towards tackling marine litter under the National Action Strategy on Marine Litter.  

**Answer:**  

1 Singaporeâ€™s National Action Strategy for Marine Litter (NASML) was launched in 2022. There are six priority areas under the NASML: Reduction of Land-Based Sources of Litter, Reduction of Sea-Based Sources of Litter, Circular Economy Approach, Research and Development, Maintaining and Strengthening Outreach and Stakeholder Engagement, and International Engagement and Collaboration.  

2 NEA has carried out a study to better understand the origins of marine plastic litter along our shoreline, inland waterways, and marine waters. The study, which was completed in end 2023, found that about 97% of plastic waste on our recreational beaches originated from marine sources. This finding reaffirms the effectiveness of our waste management strategies in preventing the introduction of plastic waste from inland activities into the sea. The study also found that during monsoon seasons, there were notably higher amounts of plastic waste washed onto our shores. In response, NEA has stepped up cleaning efforts during monsoon seasons to remove the increased amounts of marine litter. Many volunteers have also participated and led regular beach clean-ups.  

3 We have actively engaged counterparts at regional and international platforms to tackle the issue of transboundary marine litter. At the ASEAN Working Group on Coastal and Marine Environment (AWGCME), we are working with our fellow ASEAN neighbours and the World Bank on the Southeast Asia Regional Programme on Combating Marine Plastics (SEA-MaP) project, which will drive national and regional initiatives to tackle marine litter. At the international stage, we are engaging in negotiations on the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC), which aims to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment.  

4 Collectively, our efforts in the various areas will help to tackle the issue of marine litter.
