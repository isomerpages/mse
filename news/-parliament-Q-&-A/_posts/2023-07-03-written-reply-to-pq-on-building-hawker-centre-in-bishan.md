#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Building a Hawker Centre in Bishan by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Chong Kee Hiong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of inflationary pressures, whether NEA will consider building a hawker centre in Bishan to provide more affordable budget meal options for residents.

**Answer:**

1	The National Environment Agency focuses on building hawker centres in new or under-served housing estates, and considers factors such as residential catchment and the availability of comparable dining options in the vicinity.  Hawker centres would not be commercially viable if they do not have a sufficient customer base from residential dwellings and commercial facilities in the vicinity. 

2	Bishan Town already has the existing Shunfu Market & Food Centre, as well as a variety of coffeeshops and food courts. Bishan residents can also visit hawker centres in neighbouring towns, such as Blk 341 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and Blk 210 Lorong 8 Toa Payoh.  

3	The Government will continue to monitor and review the adequacy of facilities providing food options in Bishan Town.
