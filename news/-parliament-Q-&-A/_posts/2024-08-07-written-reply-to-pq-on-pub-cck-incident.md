#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on PUB Choa Chu Kang Waterworks Incident by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the fatal incident during the tank cleaning works at PUB Choa Chu Kang Waterworks (a) whether there is any significant adverse impact caused by the emission of hydrogen sulphide gas during such works on the environment and the flora and fauna in the area; and (b) what are the measures that PUB and its contractors will take to ensure the safety of the workers and environment during the upgrading of the waterworks.

**Answer:**  

1  Hydrogen sulphide emitted during tank cleaning works will be dispersed by wind, with no adverse impact on the environment, flora and fauna in the area.

2  To prepare for the upgrading of Choa Chu Kang Waterworks which is expected to commence later this year, PUB completed an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in end-2021, which was released for public consultation in mid-2022. Measures recommended by the EIA as well as key feedback and suggestions made during public consultation will be adopted once construction works start, to mitigate the projectâ€™s impact on the environment.

3  PUB takes workplace safety and health seriously. Once the construction works commence, PUB will work with the contractors to ensure that measures relating to workplace safety and health requirements are adhered to and in place for all working on-site, including the management of work in confined spaces and the risk of exposure to toxic gases and chemicals.
