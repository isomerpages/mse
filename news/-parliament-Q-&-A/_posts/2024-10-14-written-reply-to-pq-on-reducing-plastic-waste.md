#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Reducing Plastic Waste by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Ong Hua Han:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider mandating food and beverage establishments to provide tap water free of charge for paying customers to reduce plastic waste from bottled water.  
  
**Answer:**  
  
1 There are currently no plans to mandate food and beverage (F&B) establishments to provide tap water free of charge for paying customers. Nonetheless, we encourage both F&B establishments and patrons to play a part in tackling plastic waste by reducing the excessive use of disposables.
