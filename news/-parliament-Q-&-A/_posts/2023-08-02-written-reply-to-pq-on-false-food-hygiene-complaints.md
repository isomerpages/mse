#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on False Food Hygiene Complaints by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how does the Singapore Food Agency currently support hawker stall operators who face false food hygiene complaints that adversely impact their reputations; and (b) whether there are existing mechanisms through which hawker stall operators can report cases of malicious intent such as the deliberate planting of foreign objects in food.

**Answer:**

1 In situations where the feedback provider knowingly provided false or misleading information to the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), SFA will take enforcement action under section 88A of the Environmental Public Health Act for providing false or misleading information. This could result in a fine not exceeding $5,000 for first offenders, a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment up to 3 months or both for repeat offenders. If a food business operator has good reasons to suspect that someone has deliberately contaminated their food, they may wish to lodge a police report so that an investigation can be conducted.
