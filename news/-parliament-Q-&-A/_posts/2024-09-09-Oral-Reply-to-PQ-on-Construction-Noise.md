#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Construction Noise

**Mr Don Wee:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
whether NEA will permit construction worksites that utilise electric cranes, electric
power generators and electric trucks, which produce low decibel noise levels, to
operate beyond 9 pm.

**Answer:**  

1 Subject to the No-Work Rule on Sundays and Public Holidays, work is
permitted at construction sites as long as the permissible noise limits stipulated in
the Environmental Protection and Management (Control of Noise at Construction
Sites) Regulations are complied with.

2 To protect residentsâ€™ rest at night, more stringent permissible noise limits are
applied after 7.00pm and 10.00pm respectively. 9.00pm is not used as a specific
threshold in our regulations. More stringent limits also apply around residential
buildings and noise-sensitive premises, for instance hospitals, schools, institutes of
higher learning and homes for the aged. Contractors should implement noise
mitigation measures where necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable
permissible noise limits. This may include utilising quieter construction equipment,
such as electric machinery.
