#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on safety of water from water coolers by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms See Jinli Jean:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what are the measures put in place to assure end users that water from water coolers at buildings, public sites and schools is safe for consumption.

**Answer:**

1 PUB has a comprehensive sampling and monitoring programme to ensure the safety of the potable water supplied by PUB. This includes piped water supplied to buildings, public sites and schools, which may be fed into water coolers.
The water supplied by PUB complies with the Environmental Public Health (Water Suitable for Drinking) 2019 Regulations and is well within the World Health Organisation Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality.

2 Building and facilities owners are responsible for ensuring the proper installation and maintenance of water coolers on their premises. PUB and the Singapore Food Authority (SFA) will jointly investigate any water quality feedback received from the public.
