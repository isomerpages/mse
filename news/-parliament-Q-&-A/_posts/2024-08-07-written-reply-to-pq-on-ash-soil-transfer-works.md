#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Ash Soil Transfer Works by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Gan Thiam Poh:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether a further review is required for a long-term and sustainable solution to replace the need for periodic ash soil transfer works at the Inland Ash Scattering facility, Garden of Peace.

**Answer:**  

1  The Garden of Peace (GOP) at Choa Chu Kang was designed with inland ash scattering (IAS) lanes for next-of-kin to scatter the ashes of their loved ones, as well as an area designated as the final resting place for ash soil. As scattered ashes accumulate over time and the IAS lanes become full, it is necessary to transfer ash soil from the IAS lanes to the final resting place within the GOP so that others can continue to use the IAS lanes. The design of the GOP, including the process of ash transfer, was developed in close consultation with religious leaders.

2  The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been raising awareness of the IAS process, including the ash soil transfer as part of the IAS lane maintenance works. This information is also available on NEA’s website and ePortal.

3  NEA has recently introduced a three-month rest period after IAS lanes become full and are temporarily closed before the transfer of ash soil. This provides assurance to families that ash soil would not be transferred too soon after the ashes of their loved ones have been scattered. Currently, we have four IAS lanes. To ensure that there are always at least two IAS lanes in use, only two out of the four will be closed for the “rest period” or transfer works at any time.

4  Going forward, NEA will be developing additional IAS lanes and reviewing the lane design at the GOP to provide more capacity for ash scattering. While periodic ash soil transfers from IAS lanes will continue to be needed, the capacity expansion will reduce the frequency of ash transfer works. NEA will continue to communicate the IAS process to applicants at the point of IAS application, and will remind them of the ash soil transfer process and the “rest period” for IAS lanes.
