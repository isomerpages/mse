#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Climate Friendly Households Programme by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Mariam Jaafar:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) to date, how many HDB households have redeemed their Climate Vouchers under the enhanced Climate Friendly Households Programme (CFHP); and (b) what are the barriers to expand the participating retailer base of stores where Climate Vouchers under the enhanced CFHP can be redeemed, to include HDB heartland electrical stores.  

**Mr Desmond Choo:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the utilization rate of the Climate Vouchers under the enhanced Climate Friendly Households Programme (CFHP); (b) how will the Ministry promote the take-up rate for the Climate Vouchers; and (c) whether there are plans to expand the participating retailers under the CFHP to include heartlands electronics and electrical appliances stores.  

**Mr Xie Yao Quan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how many HDB households have redeemed the $300 Climate Vouchers under the enhanced Climate Friendly Households Programme; (b) whether the Ministry will consider further expanding the programme to households in private properties; and (c) if not, why not.  

**Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider extending the Climate Vouchers to residents living in Executive Condominiums (ECs), given that residents in ECs have similar household per capita income to those living in other types of public housing.  

**Mr Lim Biow Chuan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) to date, how many out of the 1.1 million HDB households have claimed the Climate Vouchers; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider giving Climate Vouchers to residents living in private estates as energy efficiency should be practised by every resident.  

**Answer:**  

1 Mr. Speaker, may I have your permission to address 3 oral PQs, No. 54 to No. 56 together for today’s sitting. My response will also cover the matters raised in the written questions by Mr. Edward Chia and Mr. Lim Biow Chuan scheduled for today’s sitting.  

2 In April 2024, the Climate Friendly Households Programme (CFHP) was expanded to all Housing and Development Board (HDB) Singapore resident households. As of 15 June 2024, more than 50% of eligible households (i.e. about 607,000 households) have claimed their Climate Vouchers. Of these, about 90,000 households have started using their vouchers.  

3 So far, the three most popular household products purchased were direct current fans, washing machines and refrigerators. The National Environment Agency (NEA) and PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, will continue to work with stakeholders, including participating retailers, to publicise the programme and promote the take-up of the Climate Vouchers.  

4 By switching to more efficient appliances and fittings, households will be able to save on their utility bills. For example, a 4-room HDB household that switches from a 1-tick refrigerator to a 3-tick refrigerator can save up to 6% on their utility bill. The savings depend on various factors, including a household’s usage pattern, size, and the appliance’s energy or water efficiency in relation to the original appliance.  

5 Households have access to a wide selection of retailers and climate-friendly appliances and fittings from the current list of 14 participating retailers, covering more than 300 stores. In addition, NEA, PUB and Government Technology Agency (GovTech) are onboarding more retailers, including heartland retailers, over the next few months. Participating retailers will need to configure their Point of Sales (POS) system to tag the eligible products in their inventory, and enable voucher redemption by households. Interested retailers who do not yet have a POS system can tap on Enterprise Singapore’s (ESG) Productivity Solutions Grant to receive up to 50% support to develop a POS system. As consumers can compare the prices across different retailers, there is market pressure on retailers to keep their prices competitive.  

6 We will continue to track the progress of and review the CFHP from time to time, taking into consideration suggestions on the scheme’s refinement and coverage.
