### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Technologies to detect Second Hand Smoke by Ms Grace Fu Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what technology is presently available to detect second-hand smoke in homes; (b) what are the limitations preventing the use of such technology, if any; and (c) when did the Ministry last conduct a review on the technology available to detect second-hand smoke in homes which is causing disamenities to neighbours.

**Answer:**
 
1 Various technologies such as indoor air quality monitors can detect volatile organic compounds and fine particulate matter, like PM2.5, which are emitted by cigarette smoke. However, such devices are unable to distinguish the source of such compounds, that is, whether they come specifically from cigarette smoke, and the location from which they originate. Elevated PM2.5 levels can be caused by many activities, including cooking or burning of incense apart from smoking.
 
2 While we continue to monitor technological developments and innovations in this area, mitigating second-hand cigarette smoke in homes ultimately requires everyone to play their part. I urge smokers to exercise social responsibility and refrain from lighting up where second-hand cigarette smoke can affect those around them, including neighbours living beside, above or below them. Families and friends of smokers, as well as the general public, can help reinforce these social norms.
