#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Recourse for People Physically Unable to Return their trays by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what is the recourse for seniors or people who are physically unable to return their trays, crockery and utensils at coffeeshops, hawker centres and food courts after having consumed food or drinks by themselves.

**Answer:**

1 Elderly patrons who are physically able to return their used trays and crockery should do so. Enforcement action will not be taken against persons who have genuine difficulties returning their trays due to frailty or physical disability. We encourage their accompanying family members or caregivers to return the used trays and crockery on their behalf. If they are dining alone and no assistance is available, cleaners will help to clear the trays and crockery left behind by them.
