#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Microplastics and Nanoplastics by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment

**Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry performs horizon scanning of the potential impact of microplastics and nanoplastics on human health and, if so, how; and (b) whether Singaporeâ€™s sustainability efforts can incorporate reducing the use of items which may contribute to microplastics and nanoplastics being introduced into the environment, food chain and daily life.

**Answer:**

1 The World Health Organisation and Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations have indicated in their respective reports in 2022 that there is insufficient data to fully understand the impact of microplastics and nanoplastics on human health. Nevertheless, we are closely monitoring international discussions and scientific studies on this topic.  

2 Microplastics and nanoplastics can be produced from the breakdown of larger plastic debris. We have implemented measures to reduce plastic waste as well as minimise the potential contribution of plastic debris into the environment and marine waters from land-based sources. These include robust waste management systems, a strict anti-littering enforcement regime, and measures to encourage businesses and individuals to reduce the consumption of single-use plastics.   

3 2024 is designated as the Year of Public Hygiene. We are increasing efforts to work with stakeholders to enhance cleanliness and address littering, including of plastic waste. We urge everyone to do your part to keep plastic litter from entering our environment.
