#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on carbon dioxide measurements in dorms by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the  Environment in assessing ventilation in migrant worker dormitories using carbon  dioxide measurements as a proxy (a) whether the Ministry will consider taking  measurements in separate locations, including workersâ€™ sleeping rooms; and (b)  whether the Ministry will include all types of dormitories, such as Construction  Temporary Quarters and Factory-Converted Dormitories.  

**Answer:**  

As mentioned in previous replies to the House, the study on ventilation  conducted by the National Environment Agency and the Ministry of Manpower in  2021 was once-off and there are currently no plans to conduct another study. If we  do conduct another study, we will consider the suggestions of the Member.
