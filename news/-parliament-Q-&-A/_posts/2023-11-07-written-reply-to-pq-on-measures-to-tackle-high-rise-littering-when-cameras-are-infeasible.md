#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on measures to tackle high-rise littering when cameras are infeasible by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what measures are being explored to tackle high-rise littering when the design of HDB blocks renders the use of CCTVs infeasible.

**Answer:**

The National Environment Agency (NEA) deploys surveillance cameras with video analytics to record acts of high-rise littering. In a small number of cases, deployment of surveillance cameras is not possible due to the design and layout of the block. For such cases, NEA will step up educational outreach to households in the affected stack, conduct stakeouts, and initiate investigations if there are eyewitness accounts.

2 We urge residents to be considerate and not commit high-rise littering acts, which is an anti-social behaviour that threatens public safety and hygiene. The statutory presumption provision on littering from residential flats, introduced from 1 July 2023, has placed greater onus on flat owners and tenants to prevent such acts.
