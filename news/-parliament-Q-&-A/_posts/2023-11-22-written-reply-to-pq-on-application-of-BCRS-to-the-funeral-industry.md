#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on application of BCRS to the funeral industry by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms See Jinli Jean:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how will the Beverage Container Return Scheme apply to the funeral industry when implemented in April 2025, in view of the higher rates of bottled water consumption at funeral wakes; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider partnering town councils and the funeral industry to set up temporary collection points for beverage containers and cardboard boxes at or near funeral wakes.

**Answer:**

1 When the Beverage Container Return Scheme is implemented, consumers can get a refund of their deposits when they return empty beverage containers at designated return points. This includes containers from beverages consumed at funeral wakes.

2 The National Environment Agency will work with the Beverage Container Return Scheme Operator to engage premises owners and other stakeholders to set up accessible and convenient return points, as well as other suitable take-back arrangements. The locations could include premises at or close to where funeral wakes are held.
