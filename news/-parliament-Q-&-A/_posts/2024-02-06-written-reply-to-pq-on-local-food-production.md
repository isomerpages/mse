#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on local food production by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and  the Environment in each year of the last 10 years (a) what is the actual output  of food produced locally; and (b) what is the percentage of local consumption  for food produced locally, as broken down by (i) meat (ii) seafood (iii) fruits  and (iv) vegetables. 

**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and  the Environment based on the Singapore Food Agency’s tender plans for farm  land, what is the expected (i) number of local food farms and (ii) production  capacity of local food farms with a breakdown by food types, in the next three  years. 

**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and  the Environment (a) whether Singapore is on track to meet the Government's  30-by-30 target to raise Singapore's food self-production level to 30% of total  food needs by 2030; (b) whether there are any sectors that lag behind and what  is being done to support them; and (c) what are the plans to enhance food  security beyond 2030. 

**Answer:**

1 The 30 by 30 vision is an ambition to grow the capability and capacity of our local agri-food sector to produce 30% of our nutritional needs locally by  2030. The agri-food sector is nascent and, like other sectors, has been hard hit  by headwinds, including manpower and supply chain disruptions and  increasing costs of production arising from COVID-19, geopolitical tensions  and climate change. These challenges have delayed the development of farm infrastructure and plans to scale up production. 

2 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has been supporting our local farms  to address these challenges, and to facilitate their capability and capacity development. For example, SFA has committed $60 million to the Agri-food  Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund to co-fund the adoption, test-bedding, and  development of productive, resource-efficient, and sustainable farming  technologies and systems to help farms increase their productivity. SFA also  supports the industry in achieving greater offtake for local produce via various  initiatives, including launching the Farm-To-Table Recognition Programme  (FTTRP) in Mar 2023 to encourage food businesses to procure local produce,  and supporting an industry-led Alliance for Action (AfA) on Local Produce  Demand Offtake and Consumer Education. 

3 As of 2022, there are 257 licensed food farms in Singapore. Local farms  produced 609 million pieces of eggs, 4,400 tonnes of seafood and 19,900  tonnes of vegetables, or around 29%, 8% and 4% of our food consumption for  those items respectively. SFA expects production output to gradually increase  over the next few years, as more productive farms become operational. We do  not track the other categories of foods as they are not grown locally in large  quantities. The Member may wish to refer to the Singapore Food Statistics  published annually by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) for further available details.

4 While we are implementing initiatives in support of our 30 by 30 vision,  the actual production output of our farms depends on consumer demand for  their products. Whenever we choose to purchase local produce, we help to  improve the commercial viability of our farms. Local production is just one  part of our overall strategy to ensure our food security over the longer term, and SFA will continue to implement a multi-pronged approach to strengthening  Singapore’s food security, which includes efforts to diversify our import 
sources.
