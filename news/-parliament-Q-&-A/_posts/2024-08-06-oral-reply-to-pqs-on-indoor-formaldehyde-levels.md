#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Indoor Formaldehyde Levels by Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment

**Miss Rachel Ong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the ban on formaldehyde in paints used for application on interior surfaces of buildings can be brought forward from 1 January 2026 and, if not, why not; (b) what penalties will be meted out for firms found to have used interior paint products with formaldehyde content exceeding the limit of 0.01 per cent of the paint weight; and (c) how many households have filed complaints in the last two years regarding formaldehyde levels arising from renovation works. 

**Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what measures are in place to ensure that imported wooden furniture that have been chemically treated and contain formaldehyde are safe for indoor use; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider implementing stricter import regulations or mandatory testing measures on imported wooden furniture to protect consumers from potential health hazards.

**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) in the past five years, how many complaints has NEA received regarding high levels of formaldehyde in new furniture; and (b) whether NEA will consider regulating formaldehyde as a hazardous substance under the Environmental Protection and Management Act given that exposure to high levels of formaldehyde can lead to cancer.

**Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry conducts checks on companies selling building products to ensure that the products offered do not contain or emit formaldehyde; (b) whether the Ministry will consider requiring renovation contractors to show proof that indoor formaldehyde concentration levels are within limit when renovations are completed; and (c) what support can be given to owners of non-air-conditioned places such as residential homes to ensure that the concentration level of unwanted chemicals in the vicinity are within safe limits.

**Dr Wan Rizal:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what steps are being taken to address health concerns related to formaldehyde emissions from wooden furniture in homes; (b) how is the Ministry monitoring and regulating the levels of formaldehyde in residential environments to ensure that they are within safe limits; and (c) whether there are plans to review and update existing regulations on indoor air quality and furniture safety standards to better protect public health.

**Answer:**  

1  My Ministry has been monitoring the issue of formaldehyde levels in indoor premises. Since 2020, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has received 19 feedback cases on formaldehyde levels arising from renovation works.

2  We announced at the Committee of Supply 2024 that we will introduce regulations on formaldehyde in interior paints. From 1 January 2026, interior paints with formaldehyde will not be allowed for sale in Singapore. ‘Formaldehyde in Paint’ will be regulated as a hazardous substance under the Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA). Companies found importing, manufacturing, possessing for the purpose of selling or offering for sale in Singapore, interior paints with formaldehyde levels equal to or exceeding 0.01% weight in weight, are, upon conviction, liable to a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment for a term up to 2 years or both. NEA will carry out market surveillance and take appropriate enforcement action.

3  This implementation timeline strikes a balance between safeguarding public health and giving the industry sufficient time to adapt to the new requirements based on its feedback. In the meantime, interior paints with no added formaldehyde are already available in the Singapore market.

4  We recognise that apart from interior paints, there are products such as composite wood products and adhesives which may emit formaldehyde. NEA is actively studying this issue, including the review of international best practices, guidelines, and regulatory requirements.

5  The furniture industry has made an effort to lower formaldehyde emissions. The Alliance for Action on Sustainable Spaces, jointly formed by the Singapore Business Federation, Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC), and Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC), developed and launched a set of industry guidelines and recommendations to improve indoor air quality last year. Among other things, these guidelines recommend formaldehyde emission limits for products and furnishing used indoors.

6  We encourage the public to use products that are certified with the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS) administered by the Singapore Environment Council, or the Singapore Green Building Product (SGBP) Certification Scheme administered by the SGBC. For wood products bearing these green labels, the formaldehyde levels are certified to be low or non-detectable, while interior paints certified with these labels are required to have no formaldehyde. The SFIC’s website also lists its member companies that have pledged to supply or adopt low or no formaldehyde products and solutions.

7  If products containing formaldehyde are installed in indoor spaces, occupants are advised to improve ventilation and promote air circulation by opening doors and windows where possible, as well as utilising fans and ventilation systems, which can help dilute the concentration of formaldehyde in those areas.
