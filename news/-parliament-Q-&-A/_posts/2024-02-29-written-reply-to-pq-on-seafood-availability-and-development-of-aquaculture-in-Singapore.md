#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on seafood availability and development of aquaculture in Singapore by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether an update can be provided on the current status of seafood availability and whether declining global catch rates are affecting food
security; and (b) whether there will be new initiatives to support the further development of aquaculture in Singapore.

**Answer:**

1 Singapore imports seafood from about 90 countries. Our diversified import sources have helped to maintain seafood availability. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) will continue to partner the industry to open up new sources and widen the range of seafood products.

2 Recent initiatives to support the further development of local aquaculture include the launch of the Aquatic Animal Health Service in August 2023 to help farms strengthen biosecurity to prevent and control diseases. SFA, the National University of Singapore and Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory signed the Aquapolis Agreement in November 2023 to strengthen R&D collaboration in aquaculture, in the areas of fish breeding and genetics, health and feed utilisation.
