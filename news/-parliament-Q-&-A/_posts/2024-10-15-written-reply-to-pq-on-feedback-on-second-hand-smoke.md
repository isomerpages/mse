#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Feedback on Second-hand Smoke by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) for each year in the past three years, what is the (i) number of feedback (ii) percentage of feedback submitted through National Environment Agency (NEA)'s online feedback form on second-hand tobacco smoke from neighbours; and (b) whether NEA will consider if feedback on second-hand tobacco smoke from neighbours warrants a specific category in the form.

**Answer:**

1 There has been a declining trend in feedback on second-hand tobacco smoke from neighbours received by the National Environment Agency (NEA) through its online feedback system. NEA received 900 instances of feedback in 2021, 260 instances in 2022, and 120 instances in 2023. These form 2.6%, 1.2%, and 0.6% of annual total feedback received via the platform.  

2 NEAâ€™s online feedback system is intended for the public to provide information on issues regulated by NEA, such as littering, smoking in prohibited places and mosquito breeding. There is a general category for feedback on other environmental issues. There are no plans to create an additional category for second-hand tobacco smoke from neighbours.
