#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Measures to Support Local Produce by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
**Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what support measures does the Government plan to implement to support local farms to increase demand and reduce wastage of produce in light of media reports of a 40% surge in leftover produce in urban farms; and (b) how does the Government plan to further collaborate with retailers and other relevant stakeholders to improve product displays and ensure efficient distribution channels for urban farm produce.

**Answer:**
 
1 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) works with the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprises Federation (SAFEF) on initiatives to drum up demand for local produce. An Alliance for Action (AfA) on Local Produce Demand Offtake and Consumer Education is ongoing, to bring together stakeholders across the food supply chain to come up with solutions to raise demand for local produce. The AfA has also supported the Farm-to-Table Recognition Programme, launched to recognise food businesses in the hotel, restaurant, and catering sector that procure locally farmed produce. These Farm-to-Table logos help consumers to identify and support food establishments that use locally produced ingredients. The success of our farms ultimately rests on consumers giving greater support for local produce in order to enhance Singaporeâ€™s food security.
