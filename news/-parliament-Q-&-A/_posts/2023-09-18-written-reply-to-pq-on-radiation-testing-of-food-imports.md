#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Radiation Testing of Food imports by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
 
**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment since Japan started releasing treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on 24 August 2023 (a) whether the Singapore Food Agency has conducted radiation testing on samples of seafood imports originating from the waters within a 100 km radius of the plant; (b) if so, how many samples have been tested; (c) whether tests include measurements of tritium concentrations; and (d) whether any increased concentration of tritium have been found in these samples.
 
**Answer:**
 
1	The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) adopts a science-based surveillance and monitoring regime to ensure that food imported into Singapore is safe for consumption. When the Fukushima incident happened in 2011, Singapore restricted food imports from affected Japanese prefectures. In the years since, we have gradually allowed food imports from the region to resume with measures to ensure food safety. This includes a radiation testing regime that covers a range of radioactive contaminants. Results from tests conducted since the discharge of treated water have met our safety requirements, which are well within internationally established safe levels. 

2	SFA will continue to closely monitor radiation levels in our food imports.
