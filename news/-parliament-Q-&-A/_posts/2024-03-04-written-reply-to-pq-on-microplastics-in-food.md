#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on microplastics in food by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether he can provide an update on the measures that the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is studying to address the presence of microplastics in food; and (b) whether SFA has any plans to implement measures to address this issue currently and, if not, what is the threshold level of microplastics in food before the SFA will consider implementing measures.

**Answer:**

1  The World Health Organisation and Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations have indicated in their reports in 2022 that there is insufficient data to fully understand the impact of microplastics on human health.

2  From 2022 to 2023, SFA collected data on microplastics levels in drinking water and food products that have been previously reported to contain microplastics. Thus far, the levels of microplastics in the surveys have not raised any cause of concern and were in line with findings published by other countries, such as the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom.

3  SFA will continue to monitor microplastics levels and international scientific developments on the topic.
