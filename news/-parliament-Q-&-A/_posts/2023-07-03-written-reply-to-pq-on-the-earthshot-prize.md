#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on The Earthshot Prize by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Miss Rachel Ong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to The Earthshot Prize ceremony supporting climate solutions to be held in Singapore in November 2023 (a) whether there will be a review of the sustainability solutions put forth by the finalists that are appropriate for application in the Singapore context; and (b) whether the Government is exploring the possibility of partnering any of the finalists on the sustainability solutions applicable to Singapore.

**Answer:**

1 The Ministry has no plans to review the proposed solutions under The Earthshot Prize nor to partner any of the finalists. However, if there are proposals which are deemed to be applicable to Singapore, we are open to exploring such reviews or partnerships.
