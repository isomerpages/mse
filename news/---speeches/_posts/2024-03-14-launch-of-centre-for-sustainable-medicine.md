#### Opening Address by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, at the Launch of the Centre for Sustainable Medicine on 13 March 2024

Professor Nick Watts, Director, Centre for Sustainable Medicine,

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to join you at the launch of the Centre for Sustainable Medicine, as well as its inaugural public plenary. Today, we will witness the opening of the first research centre in Asia and the largest in the world, dedicated to accelerating the net zero transition in healthcare, and training future healthcare leaders to respond to climate change.

**Impact of climate change on Singapore**

2  While Singapore’s location is just one degree or 137 km north of the equator and warm weather is the norm, older Singaporeans may remember most days when daily temperatures seldom crossed 30 degrees Celsius, and the nights were generally balmy and breezy. But Singapore is now getting hotter, drier and wetter due to the effects of climate change. In January, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS), under the Meteorological Service Singapore, issued the findings of the Third National Climate Change Study (V3). It cautions that we can expect higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century.

3  By 2100, Singapore can expect to become even warmer, with annual mean temperatures rising between 0.6 and 5 degrees Celsius. As a small and low-lying island state, Singapore is also vulnerable to sea level rise. The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by 0.23m to 1.15m by end century, and by up to around 2m by 2150, under the high emissions scenario.

4  An increase in the intensity of weather variability could present significant challenges to the management of our water resources. Periods of drought can affect the reliability of Singapore’s water supply, while sudden episodes of intense rainfall could overwhelm our drainage system and lead to flash floods. The increasing occurrence of erratic weather patterns around the world also threatens our food security.

**Singapore’s efforts to fight climate change**

5  Singapore's future climate depends on the world's shared socio-economic pathways. All countries will have to act collectively to fulfil their net zero commitments. To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement in limiting global warming, we are taking active steps to mitigate climate change and transit to a low-carbon future.

6  From this year, we have raised our carbon tax to $25 per tonne and will progressively raise the carbon tax level further, to $50 to $80 by 2030. As a small and alternative energy disadvantaged nation, we have to harness innovation and collaboration to transform our energy supply. For example, we are overcoming our limited land by deploying solar panels on rooftops and reservoirs and are collaborating with neighbouring countries on cross-border green energy trade.

7  Decarbonisation of the international maritime and aviation sectors is also high on our agenda as we prepare our maritime hub for a multi-fuel transition. We are piloting projects for biofuels, methanol and ammonia and collaborating with other international ports and partners to promote Green and Digital Shipping Corridors. On the aviation front, we are home to the largest production facility for sustainable aviation fuel.

**Healthcare’s role in combating climate change**

8  With the community coming together to collectively tackle climate change, healthcare needs to play its role as an affected sector. The changes that climate experts have warned us about are also impacting population health. Singapore is situated in a region where vector-borne diseases are endemic. Most cases of vector-borne diseases like dengue are observed during warmer periods of the year.

9  In addition, frequent and severe instances of warm weather may lead to more occurrences of heat stress and discomfort especially among the elderly and vulnerable. We could see more asthma and breathing-related problems due to increased pollution and reduced air quality, while rising sea levels lead to less stable infrastructure in the region. Mental health issues may increase as people develop anxieties about the changes that they experience and see. Climate anxiety has been identified as having the potential to significantly impact one’s mental health and well-being and lead to increased stress, depression and feeling of helplessness.

10  Our healthcare sector is also a major contributor to emissions. Studies have shown that while health services save lives, it has also inadvertently generated a significant amount of waste and pollution. It is a conundrum that healthcare leaders and administrators are actively addressing.

11  The launch of the Centre for Sustainable Medicine is a timely initiative that will bring together leading experts and clinicians from around the world to establish a new field of medicine and transform clinical practice. I am heartened by its ambitious aims to transform medical education and prepare future healthcare leaders to be at the forefront of the response to climate change; pioneer clinically-relevant and solutions-focused research to support high-quality, low-carbon care; and support health policymakers and hospital administrators across the world to accelerate the transition to net zero healthcare.

**Conclusion**

12  Let me conclude. Climate change is the biggest health threat of this century. Hence, the healthcare sector needs to reassess and re-calibrate the way health services are provided. I commend the Centre for Sustainable Medicine for its efforts to help shape more sustainable healthcare practices. I also commend today’s conference organiser for bringing together a distinguished gathering of experts from multiple disciplines and practices to examine and identify new, sustainable practices that will allow the essential delivery of healthcare to continue to meet increased demand and at the same time decarbonise. Thank you.
