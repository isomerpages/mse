#### Speech by Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment, at the SMU Sustainability Forum at Singapore Management University on 17 September 2024

Distinguished Guests, 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

1 A very good afternoon to all of you. I am delighted to join you at the SMU Sustainability Forum.

**Introduction**

2 I will begin with a simple but stark message - Our planet is heating up. The World Meteorological Organisation has officially confirmed that 2023 is the warmest year on record. Closer to home, 2023 was Singapore’s fourth hottest year. This year, we have already experienced Singapore’s warmest July on record. If the current weather trend continues, 2024 could even be warmer than 2023.

3 These are uncomfortable statistics, in all senses of the word. Yet, the climate change outlook for Singapore is set to get even more grim. The Third National Climate Change Study, V3, by the Centre for Climate Research Singapore was released in January this year. It showed that by the end of this century, we will have to contend with more extreme climate conditions, which include accelerating rate of sea level rise, higher temperatures, heavier rainfalls, as well as longer and more frequent dry spells.


**Our Coastal Protection Efforts**

4 Let me delve into rising sea levels. This is a serious and long-term challenge for Singapore, a small and low-lying island state. Based on the V3 findings, mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by up to 1.15 metres by 2100 and up to around 2 metres by 2150. With around 30 per cent of our land less than five metres above mean sea level, when high tide meets storm surges, the higher sea levels could mean that these low-lying areas will be under water. Hence, it is important for us to start planning ahead early.

5 Since 2021, PUB, our national coastal protection agency, has begun preparations for coastal protection with site-specific studies at various sections of Singapore’s coastline.

6 You may have heard of the ‘Long Island’ project. This is a proposed coastal protection solution for the East Coast area, that also has the potential to address other important needs such as developing more land, a freshwater reservoir and recreational amenities along the coastline.

7 We are also building our knowledge in understanding and addressing flood risks. Last year, we launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI) Singapore to strengthen local capabilities and expertise in coastal protection and flood management. CFI Singapore has initiated research projects to improve our understanding of local coastal processes and develop relevant solutions. The institute is also training a new generation of researchers and engineers to meet Singapore’s long-term manpower needs in coastal protection and flood management.


**Strengthening our Food Security**

8 With increasing climate volatility, the stability and viability of food resources worldwide will also be threatened. As a small city-state which is land and resource scarce, and imports over 90% of our food, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to global food supply chain disruptions such as disease outbreaks and geopolitical tensions.

9 To strengthen our food security, Singapore imports from over 180 countries and regions to diversify our food sources. This has worked well for us and we will continue to facilitate food imports from new sources by working closely with industry and other governments. However, the volatility of global food supply chains underscores the importance of having a buffer that can serve as a form of insurance during food supply disruptions. This is why we are building the capability and capacity of our agri-food sector to produce food locally. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is progressively developing our agri-food ecosystem of productive farms, harnessing science and technology to boost production, and preparing the necessary spaces and infrastructure. Farms can also tap on initiatives such as the Agri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund to improve productivity. As of 30 Apr 2024, SFA had awarded $25.7 million to fund 68 projects.


**Transition to a Low Carbon Future**

10 In addition to adapting to climate change, we must also take action to lower our carbon footprint. The Government is supporting industries in improving energy and carbon efficiency through capacity-building programmes on decarbonisation, and financial support for sustainability reporting and energy-efficient equipment. For example, we expanded the Energy Efficiency Grant this year to support local companies in more sectors, including construction and maritime, to invest in energy-efficient equipment. The grant offers a two-tier structure, with higher support of up to 70% provided to companies that wish to make larger investments to drive greater energy efficiency.

11 Achieving net zero requires the collective efforts of everyone – the Government, businesses, communities, as well as individuals. My Ministry has been running the annual Go Green SG national sustainability movement, in collaboration with partners from across the people, public and private sectors, to rally the community to take collective action towards a more environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient Singapore. This year’s Go Green SG saw some 200 partners organise around 400 activities for members of the public.

12 To support individuals and organisations which wish to start ground-up projects that advance environmental sustainability and engage the community, we established the SG Eco Fund. It has awarded $12.8 million, supporting more than 250 initiatives, including education and outreach on sustainable practices.


**Collaborating to Forge a Climate Resilient Future**

13 As we continue our journey towards sustainability, partnerships across the Government, the industry and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) will be key to achieving our goals. A notable collaboration is Cooling Singapore 2.0, which is a joint alliance between SMU, NUS, Singapore-ETH Centre, and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology. The Cooling Singapore 2.0 project team is developing a digital model to simulate Singapore’s urban climate and allow policymakers to assess the effectiveness of various cooling strategies such as using cool materials and increasing urban greenery.

14 Another example is the Singapore Green Finance Centre, helmed by SMU and the Imperial College Business School. Supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as well as nine other global financial institutions, the Centre taps on the IHLs’ expertise in multi-disciplinary research to develop solutions that can help Asia transit to a low carbon economy.

15 These initiatives demonstrate the integral role that IHLs play in catalysing research and innovation, incubating ideas and translating them into practical solutions to address the complex challenges we face. IHLs also serve as a vital channel to nurture our future workforce who can drive sustainability efforts in Singapore and beyond. I look forward to hearing more from all of you later on the role IHLs can play to further our sustainability agenda during the panel discussion.


**Conclusion**

16 To conclude, allow me to express my gratitude to our esteemed speakers and participants. Your presence here today signifies a shared commitment to advancing climate action.

17 I urge all of you to use this Forum as a platform to share ideas, learn from one another, and create opportunities to collaborate on innovative solutions that can build a more sustainable and climate-resilient Singapore. Thank you.
