#### Speech by Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State, Ministry Of Sustainability and the Environment, at the Asia Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit on 19 November 2024

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and gentlemen,

**Introduction**

1 Good morning to all, and for many of our guests from around the world, welcome to Singapore. It is my pleasure to join you today at the Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit.

2 This week is significant for the global discourse on sustainability and innovation. As the 29th Conference of the Parties takes place in Azerbaijan to discuss climate action, we are gathered here with the shared goal of transforming the agri-food sector and securing a sustainable future for food production.

**Innovation’s role in food security**

3 The agri-food system is facing unprecedented challenges due to factors such as climate change, disease outbreaks and geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world. Climate change is already disrupting food supply through erratic weather patterns. Prolonged droughts, heavy rainfall and floods are becoming more frequent, putting strain on crop yields. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global crop yields could fall by as much as 30 per cent by 2050 from 2022. Rising temperatures are also accelerating the spread of diseases among livestock, further threatening our food supply. Geopolitical tensions have disrupted agricultural infrastructure and policies by some governments to restrict food trades have also disrupted food supply chains, leading to higher food prices worldwide. Similarly, disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 pandemic underscored and intensified food security challenges, revealing vulnerabilities across logistical and distribution networks.

4 For a small nation like Singapore that imports more than 90 per cent of our food we consume here, we are particularly vulnerable to global food supply disruptions. This highlights the need for a local production buffer against global food supply disruptions, a form of insurance to grow some of our own food locally.

5 Innovation will continue to play a key role in helping us overcome various constraints and build our local production capabilities. In the agriculture and aquaculture sector, new technologies like precision farming, vertical agriculture, and closed-containment aquaculture systems are just a few examples of how innovation is transforming the way we grow food here. These technologies allow us to grow more with greater efficiency and climate resilience that we used to. At the same time, as we adopt new technologies and develop alternative proteins, innovation is crucial to ensuring that the food we produce is safe to eat.

6 Through the strong partnerships forged between Governments, businesses, researchers and industry, we can ensure that novel foods are developed in a well-regulated and science-based ecosystem, so consumers can feel confident with these new novel products.

7 In my speech today, I would like to share about how my Ministry, together with the Singapore Food Agency and a diverse group of stakeholders across the entire food value chain have also taken an ecosystem approach to co-develop the Singapore Aquaculture Plan.

**Building a Resilient, Sustainable Aquaculture Sector**

8 At last year’s Singapore International Agri-Food Week, I shared on plans to co-develop the Singapore Aquaculture Plan and uplift the local aquaculture sector. Various parties, Industry, nature groups, academia and research institutions, as well as various Government agencies, were interested in solutions to achieve sustainable and productive aquaculture in Singapore.

9 Hence we got together - This is the first time we have brought stakeholders from across the entire system to collectively create a roadmap and vision for our aquaculture sector in Singapore. After several months of discussions and co-creation, I am pleased to announce today the launch of our Singapore Aquaculture Plan (SAP) paper. The paper is a collaborative effort that embodies our collective vision for the sector and serves as a roadmap for future aquaculture development in Singapore.

10 Through the discussions, we sought innovative approaches to balance sustainability with productivity and to uplift the aquaculture sector. The plan has five pillars.

**Pillar 1: Space & Infrastructure Planning**

11 The first pillar is Space and Infrastructure Planning. Space and infrastructure are critical to supporting the growth of Singapore’s aquaculture sector. SFA regularly launches land and sea space tenders with long-term leases to provide the stability farms need to invest and grow. Environmental studies for key aquaculture sites ensure we balance growth with environmental responsibility.

12 We will explore the implementation of site selection studies to assess feasibility of potential aquaculture sites early in the planning process, leverage renewable energy solutions like floating photovoltaic systems and study shared infrastructure solutions like processing and storage facilities to support the sector’s growth.  

**Pillar 2: Enabling Regulations**

13 The second pillar is Enabling Regulations. A strong regulatory framework is vital to shaping the industry’s growth and ensuring its long-term sustainability. Our regulatory framework is designed to ensure that aquaculture development aligns with national standards for safety, space optimisation and environmental sustainability. Thus, to keep up with global developments in sustainability, SFA will manage farms via a nutrient budget approach. The carrying capacity model establishes the maximum allowable production from a farming area to meet environmental quality targets, protecting sensitive habitats like coral reefs and maintaining water quality. This science-based approach sets limits on nutrient (i.e. Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Carbon) discharge rather than limits on production level, and encourages farms to adopt sustainable practices and technologies to minimize nutrient output, allowing more production within a site while protecting the environment. This is in addition to our plans to strengthen farm management and animal husbandry practices under the planned Food Safety and Security Bill.

14​We will continue to support farms to meet production requirements. We recently operationalised the Aquaculture Sensing Network (ASN) to support the aquaculture industry in water quality monitoring, and to better monitor the nutrient discharges from farms, The ASN comprises of a network of water quality sensors at aquaculture zones and complemented by water and sediment sampling. This data provides operational insights on various water quality parameters, providing early warning against environmental threats such as harmful algal blooms. The ASN is an example of how sustainable growth can be achieved through technology and collaboration, to better manage our aquaculture industry in relation to global trends.

**Pillar 3: Research, Innovation, Enterprise**

15 The third pillar is Research, Innovation and Enterprise. Innovation is key to unlocking the potential of our aquaculture industry. Through our partnership with Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, the Marine Aquaculture Centre (MAC) has achieved significant breakthroughs. An example is the improvement of growth rates for Asian Seabass through a long-term selective breeding program, resulting in a significant increase in average body weight of the fish from the initial generation to the latest selectively bred line.

16 Additionally, MAC has developed large-scale indoor aquaculture system for Asian Seabass fry production and has pioneered husbandry techniques to combat disease, such as low salinity culture methods to address Big Belly Disease in seabass hatchery production.

17 To further innovation in agri-food, over $300 million has been made available under the Singapore Food Story (SFS) R&D Programme to enable R&D in the aquaculture, urban agriculture, future foods and food safety domains.  Within the aquaculture domain, research efforts are focused on areas such as the development of superior fry and fingerlings, improving feed conversion ratio and cost effectiveness, and reducing fish mortality from key diseases.  Under the SFS R&D Programme, we also established the AquaPolis Programme to strengthen the collaboration between local and international aquaculture researchers and industry players. AquaPolis stakeholders have been actively engaged to identify key problem statements and develop research proposals relevant to the industry. Together, we will embark on scalable translational R&D projects to advance industry technological capabilities, promote knowledge sharing and technology transfer, and strengthen the local ecosystem to raise the productivity and profitability of local farms. MAC will continue to play a key role in supporting AquaPolis research efforts. Researchers can already tap on MAC’s expertise in breeding and hatchery production as well as resources and test-bedding facilities to develop innovative solutions.

**Pillar 4: Ecosystem Development**

18 The fourth pillar is Ecosystem Development. Building a robust ecosystem is essential to driving the growth and competitiveness of Singapore’s aquaculture industry. Several initiatives are already in place to strengthen the sector. The Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund provides co-funding to help farms to adopt sustainable farming technologies to boost productivity and lower costs. The Aquatic Animal Health Services was introduced to provide veterinary support to farms to enhance their farm biosecurity and disease management.We have also been developing a local talent pipeline through partnerships with Institutes of Higher Learnings to equip our workforce with the skills needed to support agri-food industry innovation.

19 Dedicated funding under the ACT Fund will support the development of Closed Containment Aquaculture Systems. Central to our efforts is the launch of the National Broodstock Centre and the Hatchery Development and Recognition Programme.

20 A key focus within this pillar is the upgrading of local hatchery capabilities. They play a vital role in translating genetically superior eggs into high quality fingerlings to meet industry needs. This will reduce reliance on overseas sources, lower mortality rates, and enhance the sector’s resilience.

21 These initiatives will collectively enhance Singapore’s aquaculture ecosystem and unlock export opportunities, positioning Singapore as a leading tropical aquaculture hub.

**Pillar 5: Demand Offtake and Promotion of Local Produce**

22 The fifth and final pillar is strengthening demand offtake and promotion of local produce. We are taking a holistic approach to increase demand across individual, industry, and national levels. Since 2019, we have launched marketing campaigns and educational initiatives to raise awareness of the benefits of local seafood. We have also collaborated with supermarkets, sponsored events, and engaged the community through culinary programs. At the industry level, we’ve partnered with the Hotel, Restaurant and Catering (HoReCa) sector and introduced the Farm-To-Table Recognition Programme to recognise businesses that procure local produce. Nationally, we piloted the Food Resilience Preparedness Programme in schools to educate young Singaporeans on food security and the importance of supporting local produce.

23 SFA has been working closely with international partners to enhance market access for our locally farmed fish, providing the impetus for our farms to scale up their production. Just earlier this month, we signed protocols with China, allowing six species of our locally farmed fish to be sold into the Chinese market. This agreement represents a significant opportunity for our local farms to reach China’s vast population and further elevate Singapore’s brand of high-quality, fresh produce.

24 Moving forward, we will continue to expand marketing and consumer education efforts, highlighting the nutritional benefits of local aquaculture products, and continuing to strengthen supply chains for broader access. Through these initiatives, we aim to build consumer trust and support the sustainable growth of our aquaculture industry.

**Conclusion**

25 The Singapore Aquaculture Plan paper represents the collective vison and resolve of all stakeholders in transforming our agri-food industry. This plan not only strengthens our local food production but also paves the way for Singapore to establish itself as a leader in sustainable aquaculture practices.

26 The success of our efforts will depend on strong collaboration across the public and private sectors, as well as meaningful engagement with the wider community. The innovations discussed at this summit in both agriculture and aquaculture will play a crucial role in shaping the future of food security, not just in Singapore but across the world.

27 Let’s continue to work together to create a sustainable, resilient agri-food system that can weather the challenges of tomorrow. Thank you, and I wish you all a fruitful summit ahead.
