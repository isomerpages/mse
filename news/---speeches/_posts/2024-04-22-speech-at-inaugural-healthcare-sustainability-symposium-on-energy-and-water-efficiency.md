#### Speech by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, at the Inaugural Healthcare Sustainability Symposium on Energy and Water Efficiency on 22 April 2024

Ladies and gentlemen,  

1  Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you at the inaugural Healthcare Sustainability Symposium on Energy and Water Efficiency. Today’s symposium will focus on the healthcare industry’s efforts in sustainability and to achieve net zero emissions. I am heartened to see so many of you from the healthcare clusters and network of partners coming together to share knowledge, ideas and insights to contribute to a greener healthcare system. This will help us to achieve our 2050 net zero ambition.  

2  Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore. As a small and low-lying island city state, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.    

3  In January, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore, under the Meteorological Service Singapore, issued the findings of the Third National Climate Change Study (V3). It cautioned that we can expect higher temperatures, accelerating increase in mean sea levels, and more wet and dry extremes for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century. The increasing occurrence of erratic weather patterns around the world also threatens our access to essential resources such as energy, food and water. We need to take collective action to protect Singapore against the impact of climate change and contribute to global efforts to mitigate carbon emissions.   

4  Climate change does not just impact our environment. It also poses a threat to our health. Changes to global temperature and weather patterns bring about an increased occurrence of heat-related illnesses and vector-borne diseases – including dengue, straining our healthcare system further. What is good for the environment is good for health.  

5  Our healthcare sector is a major contributor to climate change. Globally, the healthcare industry generates more than 4.4 percent net climate emissions. While health services are essential for maintaining public health, it consumes significant amounts of energy and water, and generates waste and pollution. This is a conundrum that healthcare leaders and administrators are actively and urgently addressing. Let me share the primary ways that healthcare contributes to emissions.  

6  First, energy consumption. Healthcare facilities such as hospitals, clinics, and research laboratories require vast amounts of energy for lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, operation of medical equipment and other essential services. The energy demands of these facilities are often high due to the need for 24/7 operations, specialised equipment, and stringent environmental controls. Consequently, energy consumption in healthcare buildings contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly if fossil fuels are used to generate electricity.  

7  Second, water consumption. Healthcare facilities consume substantial amounts of water for various purposes, including for patient care, sanitation, cleaning, and facility maintenance. Water-intensive procedures such as sterilisation, surgical operations, and medical research also contribute to higher water usage in our healthcare settings. These can further increase energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.  

8  Third, building infrastructure. Healthcare buildings are typically large and complex structures with specialised infrastructure that increase energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, older healthcare facilities may have infrastructure that are less energy-efficient, further exacerbating their environmental impact.  

9  A fourth area is waste management. The healthcare sector generates significant amounts of waste, including hazardous medical waste, pharmaceutical waste, and general waste. The collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of this waste adds to the overall environmental footprint of the healthcare sector.  

10  The healthcare sector therefore plays a key role in mitigation, both as a sector affected by and as a key contributor to climate change.  

11  Our journey towards greener healthcare requires a fundamental shift in mindset – a recognition that the health of our planet is inextricably linked to the health of our communities. Initiatives to achieve sustainability in healthcare could include having energy- and water-efficient facilities, waste reduction, sustainable sourcing of supplies, and even promoting preventive healthcare to reduce long-term healthcare costs and environmental burdens.  

12  Preventive healthcare is also a key thrust of Singapore’s healthcare policy to promote a healthier population and hence a better quality of life. I note that NUHS is pursuing many sustainability initiatives across the cluster, including the use of an energy utility dashboard to track real time energy and water consumption, which can lead to more efficient use of resources and ultimately reducing our carbon footprint.  

13  I am heartened that our healthcare sector is cognisant of its impact on the environment and stepping up efforts to mitigate its carbon footprint. Today’s symposium is a push in this direction.  

14  I also recently attended the launch of the Centre for Sustainable Medicine last month. It is the first research centre in Asia and the largest in the world, dedicated to accelerating the net zero transition in healthcare, and training future healthcare leaders to respond to climate change.  A key focus would be on promoting health while minimising environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of pharmaceutical products. This includes developing eco-friendly manufacturing processes, reducing waste generation, ensuring responsible disposal of medications, and promoting research into alternative environmentally friendly treatments.  

15  Let me conclude. The healthcare sector can be a societal leader in climate action. By reassessing and recalibrating the way healthcare services are provided, and through continued collaboration with stakeholders and a steadfast commitment to driving positive change, we can pioneer solutions that not only improve patient outcomes but also enhance environmental sustainability.  

16  I commend the National University Healthcare System and the various healthcare clusters for your dedication and efforts to establish more sustainable healthcare practices. Our actions today will shape the landscape of healthcare, and build a more sustainable, climate-resilient future for all.  

17  Reducing our carbon footprint is not just good for the environment. It is essential for the health of our patients and communities.  

18  Thank you.
