### Speech by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, at the Singapore Business Forum at Singapore International Water Week on 20 June 2024

Datuk Liwan Lagang, Deputy Minister for Utility and Telecommunication, Sarawak,

Mr Chew Men Leong, President of Singapore Water Association,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

**Introduction**

It is indeed my honour and privilege to join you today at the Singapore Business Forum. This gathering of industry leaders, innovators, and professionals underscores our collective commitment to sustainable water management and the pursuit of excellence in water solutions.

**Singapore Water Association**

2 The Singapore Water Association, or SWA, was set up in 2004, exactly 20 years ago, to help develop the local water industry and showcase Singaporean companies to the world. SWA has signed Memoranda of Understanding with organisations from more than seven countries and taken part in many overseas trade exhibitions and missions. These have been efficient and effective platforms for our local companies to profile themselves overseas. The growth in SWA’s membership from nine founding members in 2004 to the current 440 members today is testament to its pivotal role in the past 20 years. I am confident that the SWA will carry on its good work for many years to come.

**Sustainable Water Solutions and Partnerships**

3 Water is a universal need, and yet more than two billion people still lack access to clean and safe drinking water. We must tackle this global challenge together by protecting our water systems and leveraging technology to improve our management of water resources.

4 Singapore turned weakness into strength and transformed into a global leader in water management through innovation and resilience. We have over the years continued to leverage on R&D to deliver new technologies and solutions for the climate challenges we face. This includes improving the efficiency and reducing the energy needed for producing NEWater to ensure the sustainability and resilience of Singapore’s water supply.

PUB is calling for a tender to commence the Phase 3 expansion of Changi Water Reclamation Plant (WRP), which will incorporate advanced membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology in the used water treatment process. The MBR technology is more space-efficient and will also be able to achieve better quality effluent for NEWater production with less overall energy.

We have also developed smart water management systems and are utilising data analytics to optimise operations and resources. To deliver this, we have developed a vibrant ecosystem within the local water industry, where the government has worked closely with industry associations like the SWA, as well as research institutions, MNCs, SMEs, and startups.

Through this water ecosystem, Singapore hopes to continue to exchange expertise and collaborate with international partners to create sustainable and resilient water solutions for a better future.

**Young Water Professional Mentorship Graduation Ceremony**

5 As noted earlier by the emcee, one of the most exciting components of today's programme is the Young Water Professionals Mentorship Graduation Ceremony, celebrating the achievements of 94 young professionals.

6 It is no wonder that I see many young faces here, all the young water professionals. Over the past six months, these individuals have undergone rigorous training amidst their busy schedules while learning from industry experts and gaining hands-on experience in cutting-edge water technologies and management practices. Throughout the program, they participated in three intensive workshops, one field project, and two mentorship sessions, equipping them with the knowledge and skills to tackle complex water challenges in three key areas: Network & Business, Treatment, and Coastal & Flooding. This journey has not only enhanced their technical expertise but also fostered leadership qualities and a collaborative spirit.

7 As they begin their new professional journey, this mentorship program nurtures connections, enables the sharing of expertise, and cultivates strong bonds between mentors and mentees.  This program has opened doors for many participants; some have secured internships, while others have found employment within the water industry. Regardless of the path, these graduates are well-positioned to deliver significant contributions to the water sector, propelling innovation and sustainable practices towards an improved tomorrow. We are also deeply grateful to the 33 mentors who generously devoted their time and efforts to this mentorship programme.

**Collaborating for Regional Sustainable Water Solutions**

8 In addition to celebrating our young professionals, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Singapore Water Association and the Malaysian Water Association Sarawak Branch will be signed this afternoon. This MoU highlights the importance of regional collaboration in addressing water challenges. Additionally, I am pleased to note the signing of one new Memoranda of Understanding with Shenzhen Water Association.

9 SWA and the Shenzhen Water Association have committed to reciprocally back each other’s events and objectives for the upcoming year. This partnership will bring opportunities to Singapore water companies in delivering technologies and solutions to international destinations and to the industrial water solutions space.

**Conclusion**

10 In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation to the Singapore Water Association for organising very meaningful and impactful event. Let us continue to work together, share our knowledge, and inspire each other as we navigate the complex water challenges of our time. Your presence here today is a testament to your commitment to this vital cause. I am confident that our collective efforts will lead to significant advancements in the water sector.

11 I look forward to the productive discussions and collaborations that will emerge from today’s business forum. I wish you the most fruitful and meaningful attendance in this Singapore International Water Week. Thank you very much.
