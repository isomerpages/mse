### Speech by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, at the COP28 Singapore Pavilion Official Launch on 30 November 2023

1	The Singapore Pavilion is back at COP28, and this time – bigger and bolder. 

2	To us, the Singapore Pavilion is not just a physical space. It represents our commitment to climate action. It allows Team Singapore – made up of the public, private, and people sectors – to show what we are doing collectively to tackle the challenge of our generation.

**Singapore’s Commitment**

3	Singapore is a small city-state, lacking in renewable energy. We are a low-lying island that is acutely vulnerable to the threat of rising sea levels. We are an urbanised city near the equator, susceptible to rising temperatures.

4	Therefore, Singapore recognises climate change as an existential threat. Despite our circumstances that make it more difficult for us to decarbonise quickly, we know the urgency of mitigating climate change. 

5	Last year, we raised our national climate target to achieve ‘net zero emissions by 2050’ as part of our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy. Our pledges are backed with plans – that is the typical Singapore way. Among our efforts, we are maximising solar energy deployment, connecting to regional power grids, and switching to greener transportation.  

**Importance of Partnerships**

6	The government cannot solve climate change alone. It is especially important for Singapore to spark innovation, leverage technology, and rally stakeholders to achieve our climate goals. 

7	We need scientists, innovators, corporates, investors, and civil society to work together. You hold the ability to unlock the solutions needed to mitigate climate change, and build a climate-resilient future. I look forward to the many exciting announcements, innovation showcases, and insightful discussions that our Partners will be staging at our Pavilion.

**Accelerating Collective Climate Action**

8	Finally, our decarbonisation efforts rely on international cooperation. We derive strength from our willingness to collaborate with the world. And we bring value to our partners, with our position as a maritime, aviation, and finance node in Asia. With your contributions and support, we can all aspire to make a difference beyond our borders.

9	The Singapore Pavilion will bring together global leaders from diverse sectors and professions to foster collaboration. We look forward to welcoming guests and visitors from all over the world over the next two weeks. It is here that we hope to forge new partnerships and accelerate climate actions together.

10	Thank you for supporting the Singapore Pavilion.
