### Opening Address by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, at the 20th Asia Pacific Regional Rotaract Conference on 2 June 2024

Dr John Chan, District Governor of The International Rotaract District 3310

Mr Alan Yip, Chairman of the Asia Pacific Rotaract MDIO

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and gentlemen,

I am honoured to address you at the 20th Asia Pacific Regional Rotaract Conference (APRRC). After 15 years, Singapore is honoured to once again host this gathering.

2  The APRRC is an annual regional Rotaract event that provides a platform for ideas and cultural exchanges amongst Rotaractors, as well as promotes project collaboration focusing on sustainability and community development. It is a testament to the vital role that our youths play in shaping a more sustainable and resilient future for our communities. 

**Singapore’s Constraints and our Climate Action Plan**

3 Singapore has always prioritised sustainable development. Some of us have probably wondered: What will Singapore be like in 10, 20, 50 years from now? Will we have enough resources to support ourselves? Are we doing enough to mitigate and adapt to climate change? We see environmental sustainability not as a trade-off with economic development, but as a cornerstone of our economic and social progress. From our early days of nation-building, we have strived to achieve both economic growth and environmental protection. When we achieved independence, one of our priorities has always been making sure that we have a good quality living environment. We have to take into account of the economic development together with environmental conservation and protection for the benefit of our people.

4  Climate change poses a threat to Singapore. As a small island nation, we are acutely aware of our vulnerability, our lack of natural resources and alternative renewable energy for instance. Yet, this also drives us to be at the forefront of innovation and adaptation. In 2021, our Government launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 to rally the nation to take collective action in combating climate change. Through our Green Plan, we are tackling climate change head-on. We are diversifying our energy sources, exploring solar energy deployment and regional power grids. Additionally, we are adopting a circular economy approach to reuse and recycle resources, turning trash into treasure, and producing and consuming sustainably. We are also strengthening our food and water security, and protecting our coastlines from rising sea levels. 

5  I would like to share more on protecting our coastlines as it is one of the more pressing issues faced by Singapore and our neighbours. 

6  Like many low-lying cities in our region, Singapore is vulnerable to the threat of rising sea levels. In January this year, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore published the findings of the Third National Climate Change Study (V3), cautioning that we can expect more extreme weather conditions and accelerating increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century. By 2100, Singapore can expect to see annual mean temperatures rising between 0.6 and 5 degrees Celsius. This means that our annual average temperature of 28.2 degrees Celsius will rise to between 28.8 to 33.2 degrees Celsius.

7  Our appointed national coastal protection agency, PUB has been tasked to address these challenges. Since 2021, PUB has begun to develop the Coastal-Inland Flood Model to assess flood risks holistically. This adopts advanced modelling techniques to understand the combined effects of rainfall-runoff and coastal surge events, to guide our flood protection plans. Additionally, coastal protection strategies are being formulated progressively alongside new developments in climate science. We are also developing engineering solutions with nature-based enhancements, such as sea walls, earthen bunds, and mangroves which can minimise sea-level rise impacts and enhance our biodiversity. 

8  Community engagement is also an integral part of PUB’s coastal protection efforts. Our Coastal Conversation series was launched in 2022 to facilitate community dialogues on how we can reimagine and remake our coastlines while balancing the different needs and aspirations of stakeholders, and considering the trade-offs needed. 

**Partnering Our Neighbours**

9  Singapore’s unique position as a small island state makes us especially vulnerable to climate change, but it also places us at the heart of innovation and adaptability. This reality drives our commitment to enhancing our sustainability efforts and partnering our neighbours in the Asia Pacific region in this global endeavour.

10  At the regional level, Singapore launched the Climate Action Package and Sustainability Action Package under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, which offer tailored training and capacity-building courses to support developing countries in the region. These courses cover critical areas such as climate change adaptation, mitigation strategies, green finance, sustainable urban planning, water and waste management, and renewable energy solutions.  

11  The courses have empowered many professionals from across the region, enhancing their capabilities to implement sustainable solutions. We believe that sharing best practices and expertise can have a multiplier effect by passing on relevant skills and knowledge to developing countries for adaptation to their unique national circumstances.

12  We also partner with like-minded countries to import low-carbon electricity from the region. Last year, the Singapore Government issued Conditional Approvals for 4.2 Gigawatts of imports from Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. When implemented by 2035, these projects will meet about 30% of our electricity needs. In turn, this will support our neighbours’ development of renewable energy projects and form the building blocks towards our shared vision of an ASEAN Power Grid. 

13  Singapore is committed to doing our part as a global citizen and will continue to work with like-minded countries, regionally and globally, to push for sustainable development.

**Youths’ Involvement in Sustainability **

14  Our youths play an important role in tackling climate change. In Singapore, we invest in platforms that empower our young leaders to shape their communities. This includes supporting youth-led sustainability projects and providing forums for young voices at regional and global climate and sustainability conferences such as the United Nations’ 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) in UAE. Our COP28 youth delegates helped to share the Singapore story and deliver curated youth programmes at the Singapore Pavilion.

15  In my work here at the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), I have had the opportunity to interact with many passionate youths who have made and continue to make a difference in their communities. One such example is LepakInSG, an environmental advocacy group led by youths. They organised a series of discussions with subject matter experts and members of the public to gather and share feedback on our Green Plan. Another youth advocate is Woo Qiyun, founder of The Weird and Wild – an Instagram page that produces accessible environmental content to advocate, educate and engage communities on climate change. I am proud to share that Qiyun was named one of 15 National Geographic Young Explorers globally in 2023. It is an award that recognises youths who are changemakers in using their voices to protect our world. 

16  There are also various platforms for youths to participate in discussions, co-deliver, and co-create solutions with the Singapore Government to support our sustainability transitions. The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS), National Youth Council (NYC) and MSE launched a Climate Youth Development Programme last year to deepen our youths’ knowledge of environmental sustainability and climate action, and develop a network of environmental champions with a heart to make a positive difference. Singaporean youths who are interested to build up capabilities and collaborate with like-minded peers to drive ground-up action can apply for the programme when registrations open this month. 

17  Members of the community in Singapore, including youths, who require support for their ground-up projects that advance environmental sustainability can tap on the $50 million SG Eco Fund. Established by my Ministry, the Fund has supported over 250 projects to date. We hope to see more individuals, organisations and community groups submit applications.

18  Go Green SG, my Ministry’s month-long, annual national movement will take place from 12 June to 14 July this year, and will feature a wide range of sustainability-related events and activities by our people, public and private (3P) sector partners. Through these programmes and activities, youths and members of the public can learn and commit to making sustainability a way of life. I encourage you to register for these activities with your family and friends at www.gogreen.gov.sg.

19  The Rotaract clubs have been at the forefront of driving sustainable changes in the Asia Pacific region. Your club's vigour, dynamism, and emphasis on both community service and professional development make you an ideal changemaker in sustainability projects. 

20  Take for instance, during the 2023 Rotaract Friendship Exchange Programme in the Philippines, youths from the Singapore and the Philippines Rotaract clubs collaborated to plant 30 mangrove saplings in Batangas on a mangrove planting project. Mangroves are essential for removing carbon from the atmosphere and can help combat climate change through carbon sequestration. Additionally, mangroves play a crucial role in limiting the impact of extreme weather events by absorbing the impact of waves and protecting higher ground.

21  I am also heartened that the APRRC Singapore conference will feature a service project for the Rotaract clubs’ youth delegates. Tomorrow, on 3rd June, the youth delegates will come together for a beach clean-up at East Coast Park. Besides contributing towards a cleaner and greener environment, this initiative also encourages collaboration and networking amongst the youth delegates.

22  The role of youth in this environmental sustainability journey cannot be overstated. Your actions and advocacy create ripples that can turn into waves of change across borders. 

**Conclusion**

23  To our friends and neighbours across Asia Pacific, I urge all of us to continue strengthening our ties and to share our successes and lessons learnt. Let’s build upon our existing collaborations and forge new ones. Our cohesion can be a powerful catalyst for change, driving us towards our shared goals of environmental sustainability and resilience. 

24  The responsibility for sustainable development does not rest solely on the shoulders of our governments. It is an endeavour that requires the collective efforts of all sectors of society. By choosing sustainable practices and advocating for positive change, we can all contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.

25  Thank you.
