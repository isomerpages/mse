#### Speech by Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment, at the Charting towards Net Zero in the Public Sector event on 15 December 2023

Mr Soh Wai Wah, Principal and CEO, Singapore Polytechnic 

Ladies and gentlemen 

Good morning. I am pleased to join you for today’s event to discuss how we can chart towards Net Zero in the Public Sector. 

**Introduction** 

2 COP28 just ended two days ago, where there had been a lot of attention on energy transition. For the first time, all countries have agreed to a text that called for a transition away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly, and equitable manner. Countries also backed the call for global renewable energy to be tripled and the rate of energy efficiency improvements to be doubled by 2030. The consensus on transitioning away from fossil fuels is significant as this is the first time that we are addressing fossil fuels in a Decision. It is clear that the world will substitute fossil fuels with renewable energy. 

3 The global stocktake at COP28 has made it clear that 1.5 degree Celsius is the collective global goal and the world needs to do more to achieve this goal. At the same time, it has established several transition pathways – in energy, mobility, nature – and called on countries to include all sectors, and all gases (including methane) in their next NDCs, with higher ambition. This is significant in several ways: 

a) Businesses and financiers will get the market signal on the scale and speed needed to expand the capacity of renewable energy, including all supporting infrastructure (e.g. grid) and services. 

b) Serious efforts in improving energy efficiency are needed, such as in the built environment and industrial sectors, so as to contribute to the global goal of doubling EE improvement. 

c) Technologies such as carbon capture and storage, low-carbon hydrogen are to be accelerated. 

d) In addition, there needs to be fundamental shifts in everything we do, from how we travel, live, and consume goods and services. This applies to the public sector too. 

**Climate Action in the Public Sector**

4 In 2021, the Singapore Public Sector launched GreenGov.SG as its own sustainability movement. It aims to lead our nation’s sustainability journey, by raising the bar in the public sector’s sustainability targets, embedding sustainability in our core operations, and building a culture of sustainability among our officers. The public sector has committed to achieve net zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of our national target. In addition, we will reduce our energy and water use by 10% and waste disposed of by 30% respectively in 2030. 

**GreenGov.SG Report**

5 My Ministry announced in March this year that the Government will publish an annual GreenGov.SG report, starting in Financial Year 2023. From FY2024, our Statutory Boards will also publish their own environmental sustainability disclosures.  

6 We are publishing these reports for several reasons. 

a) First, to increase transparency and accountability. It is important for the public sector to show that it is serious about meeting its commitments and give visibility on its progress. 

b) Second, to ensure good stewardship of resources. By tracking how much it has consumed, the public sector will be motivated to identify gaps and opportunities to reduce its footprint further. 

c) Third, to promote an exchange of knowledge and ideas. Before we developed the report, we invited members of the public to share their thoughts and expectations. Their main message was that the report should speak simply, to help our citizens understand the climate-related changes and actions that the public sector was taking to address these changes. 

7 I am therefore pleased to present the inaugural GreenGov.SG report which: 

a) Summarises the public sector’s targets and progress in environmental sustainability; and 

b) Lays out our broad strategies to achieve our goals. 

**Performance and Strategies**

8 In terms of performance, the public sector’s total emissions decreased by 5.3% in FY22, compared to FY20. This was mainly due to the closure of the Tuas Incineration Plant in 2022. We expect our emissions to peak around 2025, as more activities resume post-pandemic, and more new major public infrastructure are opened in the coming years, for transport, healthcare and utilities.  These are necessary to meet the needs of our population. 

9 Nevertheless, we will put in place comprehensive measures to reduce our emissions. We will green our buildings to meet best-in-class standards, convert our car and public bus fleets to clean energy vehicles, reduce waste generation and increase solar deployment. In the longer term, we will pursue more low-carbon electricity imports and other technologies such as hydrogen. These will bring us closer to our goal of net zero emissions. 

10 In terms of energy and water use, the public sector’s consumption saw a slight increase in FY22, compared to the baseline. This was mainly due to the gradual reopening of the economy and an increase in activities, after two years of safe management measures which saw operations of many facilities scaled down. Going forward, we expect to see a downward trend, as we implement more resource-saving measures. 

11 The report currently does not include performance data for waste. We have nonetheless elaborated on our waste management strategies, and highlighted examples of how they are being implemented on the ground. The public sector will include our waste data in future GreenGov.SG reports. 

12 On this note, I am pleased to be launching the Green Gov.SG report at Singapore Polytechnic.  I thank SP for its leadership in developing a Decarbonisation Playbook for Institutes of Higher Learning, which Principal Soh Wai Wah will share more about later. This playbook documents SP’s own approach to achieve net zero. SP is also helping to build up industry capability, by collaborating with KPMG to provide decarbonisation training programmes for enterprises, and conducting courses to promote sustainable behavioural change. Such ground up initiatives help to accelerate the policy measures we are putting in place to decarbonise the public sector. Such training also prepares our youths to play important roles in advancing sustainability in our society and economy in the future.  

**Conclusion**

13 Each time I witness the passion of our youth for the environment, I am reminded that embracing sustainability is more than just a choice. It represents our commitment, as stewards of this planet, to cultivate a better world for our present and future generations. I hope that our efforts under GreenGov.SG will resonate with more corporates, community groups and individuals to join us in taking collective ownership of our national efforts to build a more sustainable future. 

14 With that, I wish everyone a pleasant day ahead. Thank you.
