#### Opening Remarks by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, at the Public Hygiene Council's Bulky Waste to Wonder Competition 2024 Finals on 27 October 2024 at South Beach Tower

Mr Andrew Khng, Chairman, Public Hygiene Council

Distinguished Guests, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 

1	Good morning. I am delighted to join you all here today for the finals of the Public Hygiene Council’s Bulky Waste to Wonder Competition 2024. 

**Bulky Waste Littering**

2	For those of you who live at housing estates, I am sure it is not uncommon to see bulky items such as old furniture being discarded along common corridors or at lift landings. Some residents may leave their bulky items there because they are too heavy to be shifted downstairs to be disposed of – despite Town Councils offering free removal services. However, leaving unwanted bulky items at common areas is actually considered an act of littering. 

3	Littering makes our environment unsightly. Discarded bulky waste also poses health and safety risks. 

4	For example, discarded furniture can collect stagnant water, becoming a breeding habitat for mosquitoes. They can also pose a fire hazard or become obstructions in times of emergency evacuations.
	
5	Instead of viewing these common bulky items as just waste, there is an opportunity to see them as valuable resources to be recycled or repurposed. I am heartened to see how the students have repurposed old, discarded furniture into interesting and useful new items – such as guitar storage, a games table, and even an indoor urban farming cabinet. 

6	And our community partners have already shown interest in adopting these repurposed furniture pieces. New Life Community Services is keen on them for their Active Aging Centres, and Bedok Constituency is interested for their upcoming Community Library. 

**Bulky Waste to Wonder Competition**

7	This is the meaningful objective behind PHC’s Bulky Waste to Wonder Competition. It encourages students to reimagine bulky waste and explore innovative ways to redesign and repurpose bulky waste into something functional. The students should be proud of themselves for their contributions to the community. 

8	This is the second time that the competition is being held, and I am heartened to learn about the positive response from students and schools. This reflects the growing enthusiasm from our youth for mindful, sustainable practices that ultimately contribute to a cleaner and greener Singapore. 

9	I look forward to viewing the interesting upcycled creations by our ten finalists later. 

10	By fostering a culture of sustainability among the next generation, we are empowering our youth to take an active role in waste management and environmental stewardship.

11	I would like to thank all the students who took part in this meaningful competition. I hope you had a good and meaningful experience learning about how to give a second life to waste. I would also like to thank J.O.E Eco Alliance and the Ministry of Education, for strongly supporting PHC in this competition. 

12	Collective effort and collaboration with such committed partners will allow us to achieve our goals for a clean and green Singapore. 

**Increased Community Participation at SG Clean Day**

13	Coincidentally, today is also SG Clean Day. It is a movement held quarterly, where all Town Councils and partners cease sweeping at selected areas. This initiative aims to show us the amount of litter we accumulate when we go without cleaners.  

14	In this Year of Public Hygiene in 2024, we have seen increased participation for SG Clean Day among individuals, corporate organisations and community partners, in promoting and maintaining a cleaner and more hygienic environment. 

15	This is heartening, as it aligns with our commitment to raise the standards of public cleanliness and hygiene in Singapore. 

16	Simple acts – such as picking up litter after ourselves or binning our trash responsibly – can create a ripple effect of positive change. We must take responsibility for the cleanliness of our public spaces. 

17	Thank you for your commitment to this cause, and let us continue working together for a cleaner, greener Singapore!
