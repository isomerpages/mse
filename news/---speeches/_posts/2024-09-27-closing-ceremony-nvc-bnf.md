#### OPENING REMARKS BY MS GRACE FU, MINISTER FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND MINISTER-IN-CHARGE OF TRADE RELATIONS, AT THE NEWATER VISITOR CENTRE AND BEDOK NEWATER FACTORY CLOSING CEREMONY

1  We are here to mark a milestone in our NEWater story. Many of our long-standing partners, colleagues, and friends are here. All of you have made important contributions to our first NEWater factory and the NEWater Visitor Centre.

**NEWater Journey – Overcoming our Challenges with Fortitude and Determination**

2  Where we are today, is a landmark of our water infrastructure. It marks specifically our NEWater journey, a journey that has been characterised by two defining traits – fortitude and determination. It began from the start of the independence of our nation, when Singapore’s water security was an existential challenge. Unwilling to bow to the constraints that we are dealt with, our pioneers described the “North Star” for our nation – a vision that we shall overcome our limitations to be masters of our own destiny. We took a bold leap into unchartered territory, and explored possibility of creating new sources of water for ourselves. Turning used water into potable water was a far-fetched idea but we pursued it nevertheless. We needed the technology that wasn’t there; we need to build the network of sewage drains to collect the used water from the whole country; we needed the money to build this system.

3  With an indomitable spirit, our pioneers made this vision a reality. One of them is PUB’s Senior Consultant, Mr Harry Seah, then a junior engineer. Together, the team understood the significance of recycling water and was keenly aware of the gravity of the project. These pioneers put in long and arduous hours of research and meticulous work, steadfastly working through every challenge that came their way. They dedicated their entire working lives and careers to make this a reality.

4  The team in PUB was not alone in this journey. They consulted and received guidance from experts in the fields of water quality, water reuse and membrane technology. Scientists and professionals were brought in to form the International Expert Panel on NEWater, chaired by Emeritus Professor Ong Choon Nam, an internationally renowned expert in the domain of environmental health and toxicology.

5  Through decades of investment in research and innovation, the relentless efforts of our pioneers finally bore fruit. In 2002, at the National Day Parade, NEWater was formally introduced as our third National Tap, marking a historic moment in our nation’s water story. Over 60,000 Singaporeans came together to raise a toast to NEWater, celebrating a national achievement that was not just a technological breakthrough but a symbol of Singapore’s resilience.

6  This moment marked a pivotal milestone. It demonstrated our ability to successfully recycle used water on a large scale. It gave us a new source of water, gave every drop of water an endless life, gave our nation long-term resilience, and gave us an assurance about our future.

7  The NEWater journey demonstrated many other values.

8  There was “Quality” – we had wanted to assure that our NEWater was of high quality, safe enough to drink, meeting the World Health Organisation’s Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality. NEWater proved to be well suited for use in industries like wafer fabrication and pharmaceuticals, which require stringent, high purity water in their processes.

9  There was “Rigour” - Many tests and processes were performed to ensure that we meet the high standards and do so consistently.

10  There was “Persistence” - NEWater was unheard of at that time. Former PUB Assistant Chief Executive Mr Tan Thai Pin knocked on the doors of many wafer fabs to broach this proposal and was met with skepticism. Convincing the industry of the reliability and quality of NEWater was no small feat. Through repeated calls and rounds of demonstrations of NEWater technology and infrastructure, they were able to convince the companies.

11  The breakthrough came when Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company (SSMC) became the first customer to support and adopt NEWater in the wafer fabrication industry. This paved the ways for others to follow suit, and Singapore became the first in the world where wafer fabrication plants used recycled water in their operations. Today, NEWater is supplied to more than 860 industry customers and has been acknowledged for its quality and consistency.

12  STMicroelectronics, one of NEWater users for over twenty years, shared that NEWater’s quality and consistency have enabled them to achieve high cost-efficiency and increased operational resiliency. Sharing PUB’s belief towards conserving water as a precious resource, STMicroelectronics is exploring more water recycling projects to optimise the use of NEWater.

13  NEWater adoption is not limited to the wafer fabrication industry. It has become an integral operation of the data centre industry. Amazon Web Services’ data centres in Singapore use NEWater in their cooling towers. The superior and stable water quality of NEWater improves water efficiency, which in turn enhances energy efficiency in their operations.

14  Beyond our shores, NEWater gained international acclaim by clinching the prestigious award for “Environmental Contribution of the Year” at the 2008 edition of the Global Water Awards. It is an endorsement of Singapore’s comprehensive NEWater strategy and set a global benchmark for water reuse.

**Continuation of our NEWater Journey**

15  More than two decades have passed since we first launched NEWater to the public. Today, NEWater continues to be of great significance in Singapore’s history. It gave Singapore our first weather resilient water source. It enabled Singapore to reuse every drop and in doing so, allowed us to close the water loop. It also changed the way Singapore met industries’ water needs.

16  Our NEWater journey is far from over. As Singapore’s water demand is expected to almost double by 2065, NEWater’s role as a reliable and weather-resilient National Tap remains crucial. We are making good progress in our long-term plans to bolster NEWater production. Even as we close BNF, we are replacing it with a third NEWater plant in Changi. This new Changi plant will have a capacity of 50 million gallons per day (mgd), as compared to Bedok’s 18 mgd. In addition, a new 75 mgd NEWater plant will be integrated within the future Tuas Water Reclamation Plant, which is under construction now.

17  Just as our pioneers have soldiered through challenges, we must continue to advance our used water recycling and treatment technology and infrastructure, ensuring we remain at the forefront of water innovation and management.

18  We are now working on improving recovery rates from 85% to 90% with Flow-Reversal Technology in Reverse Osmosis membranes, thus producing more NEWater from the same amount of used water. PUB has been working with ROTEC in piloting their proprietary Flow-Reversal technology. The trials have been proven successful and this technology will be implemented in the upcoming Changi NEWater Factory 3.

19  In addition, PUB is working with Aquaporin Asia to pilot test the world’s first biomimetic low-energy membranes, which are designed to mimic filtration through natural water channels. Initial trials have yielded promising results, with the potential to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent.

**Winning the Hearts and Minds of Singaporeans through NEWater Education**

20  Our achievements would not have been possible without public acceptance. The idea of recycling used water has not been broadly accepted elsewhere in the world because of public aversion to the idea. We knew that we have to overcome this psychological resistance, and undertook extensive public education and engagements.

21  The NEWater Visitor Centre (Centre) was an important platform in this endeavour. We co-located the Centre with the Bedok NEWater Factory when it opened in 2003.

22  The Centre translated complex scientific concepts into bite-sized information, through interesting and interactive displays and immersive tours. Visitors had the opportunity to walk through a viewing gallery that extended across the NEWater Factory, allowing them to observe the day-to-day operations of the factory and gain a deeper appreciation of the processes involved in water treatment.

23  Young visitors particularly enjoyed playing the role as water molecules, undergoing the treatment process through the exhibits. These experiences left a lasting impression, which has helped visitors of all ages understand the value of clean water and the sophisticated technology behind NEWater.

24  The impact of the Centre is seen in Mdm Nazeera Sulaimi, a teacher at Greenwood Primary School, who fondly recalled visiting the NVC as a student and returning many years later with her own students.

25  The Centre has indeed educated generations of Singaporeans. It has made a significant impact on more than 1.7 million visitors, bridging the gap between the public and the science behind advanced water technology. Although the Centre has officially closed, our commitment towards NEWater education remains.

26  We are now working on developing an exhibit to showcase NEWater at the Sustainable Singapore Gallery, as well as incorporating NEWater education in our ongoing engagement with our partners and the community. Our mission to educate the public on the importance of water sustainability will continue albeit in different shapes and forms. In the longer term, NEWater will be featured as one of the key exhibits in a learning gallery located at the upcoming Tuas Nexus.

**Conclusion**

27  The NEWater Visitor Centre and Bedok NEWater Factory have been instrumental in the success of our NEWater journey over the past 21 years.

28  We owe our achievements to the vision, courage and determination of our pioneers, who never gave up trying to turn their vision into reality.

29  Their foresight and perseverance have strengthened Singapore’s water resilience. They have enabled us to meet the nation’s growing water demands and face the water challenges brought about by climate change, and to do so with confidence and optimism.

30  As we progress in our NEWater journey, let us continue to honour their legacy by sustaining our commitment to Make Every Drop Count!
