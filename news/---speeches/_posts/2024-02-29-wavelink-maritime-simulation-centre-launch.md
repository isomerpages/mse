Distinguished Guests,

Ladies and gentlemen,

A very good morning to all on this ‘leap day’.

2 I am delighted to join the SMOU, alongside tripartite partners, at the “Advancing Maritime Resilience: No One Is Left Behind” seminar and launch of the Wavelink Maritime Simulation Centre.

**Impetus For Maritime Decarbonisation**

3 The impetus for the decarbonisation of the maritime industry is clear.

a. We have seen the adverse effects of climate change affecting shipping routes and maritime operations.

i. For instance, severe droughts during the past summer led to critically low water levels in the Panama Canals, reducing traffic by 40% and slowing the global trade of goods.

b. At the same time, global shipping accounts for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. And its emissions are expected to continue to rise.

4 The maritime industry thus has a key role to play in reducing its emissions and contributing to the fight against climate change.

a. The International Maritime Organization (or IMO) has set out enhanced ambitions for international shipping to reach net-zero emissions by or around 2050, among other emissions reduction measures and targets.

b. There are a variety of opportunities to enhance the energy efficiency of ships, optimise maritime operations, and scale the use of new green fuels.

5 As a maritime nation whose story is inextricably linked to the sea, Singapore will play our part.

a. We have been a strong supporter of global efforts to decarbonise the maritime industry. And we will continue to actively contribute to and facilitate consensus at the IMO.

b. We are also working with like-minded partners to create sustainable maritime ecosystems, such as through establishing green and digital shipping corridors and developing harmonised standards and regulations for the safe handling and bunkering of future marine fuels.

c. And domestically, we are decarbonising our port and harbourcraft operations in line with Singapore’s national climate target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, pioneering technology adoption in the process.

**Importance of Just Transition**

6 As we transit towards sustainable shipping, we must not forget that people are at the heart of the industry.

a. We will need to ensure that our maritime workforce is ready and equipped to support the sector’s inclusive transformation.

7 The Government has been working with industry players, unions, and Institutes of Higher Learning to build a strong, future-ready workforce to ride this wave of change.

a. The Maritime Just Transition Task Force, founded by international organisations and the Singapore Maritime Foundation (SMF) as its program partner, was set up to bring together government agencies, unions, employers, and academia, to help shipping companies look at future skills required for seafarers in the green transition.
   
b. MPA and SMF have also worked with Pacific Carriers Limited, Pacific International Lines, and Ernst & Young to develop and publish the Maritime Workforce Transformation Guidebook.

i. The Guidebook was distilled from key findings and actionable recommendations of a job redesign pilot conducted in 2022.

ii. It offers a practical approach for companies in the maritime sector to embark on job redesign and transform their workforce to meet the evolving needs of the industry.

**SMOU’s Efforts**

8 This leaves me to thank the SMOU for organising today’s seminar and bringing the focus on training and tripartism.

a. Indeed, ‘people’ and ‘partnership’ will be ever more important in ensuring that:

i. The industry adapts well to global trends such as sustainability and digitalisation;

ii. And our workforce is equipped with the skills to perform their roles effectively and seize opportunities in the transition.

9 The Wavelink Maritime Institute, SMOU’s training arm, remains poised to support the industry.

a. Since 2007, the Wavelink Maritime Institute has trained over 25,000 officers and cadets.

i. This includes young cadets choosing to pursue seafaring as a career, and existing officers who wish to upgrade their skills and competency as part of their Continuing Education and Training.

10 The enhancement of the Wavelink Maritime Simulation Centre marks a new chapter in SMOU’s mission of preparing future-ready seafarers.

a. I was pleased to witness the immersive learning experience that the new simulation centre offers.

b. The simulation of real-world scenarios enables seafarers to develop decision-making abilities and refine their operational proficiency.

c. The engine simulator is tailored to train seafarers for the complexities of handling alternative fuels such as LNG, methanol, and ammonia; while the bridge simulator offers a range of scenarios for seafarers.

d. This enhances the integration and collaboration in training and cooperation between Deck and Engineering officers.

11 Let me also thank the SMOU for your important contributions in advocating for our seafarers, and in maintaining excellent relations with both employers and the Government.

a. Our strong tripartite partnership is one of our key competitive advantages. And it will continue to serve us well as we prepare our workforce for the future of shipping.

**Conclusion**

12 Let me conclude. Many of us would know that today, 29 February, was inserted as an additional day to sync our calendars with the length of the natural year.

a. Without ‘leap days’, our calendars would fall out of sync with the seasons – by about 24 days after 100 years!

13 And yet, climate change has altered many of the seasonal patterns that countries are used to – shifting the timing of spring snowmelt, the flowering of cherry blossoms, the length of time that lakes stay frozen, and more.

14 The time for action is now – if we want to avoid the worse impacts of climate change and ensure a liveable world for future generations. I encourage the maritime industry to continue to take bold leaps forward, with everyone onboard.

15 Thank you again for having me, and I wish everyone a productive day ahead. Thank you.
