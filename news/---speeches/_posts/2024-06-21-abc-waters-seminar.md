### Opening Address by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, at the ABC Waters Seminar on 21 June 2024

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and gentlemen,

A very good morning to everyone. It is my pleasure to join you at this “Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters” seminar.

2 First, let me thank the Institution of Engineers Singapore for co-organising this seminar with PUB for the past fourteen years, as well as the Singapore Institute of Architects and the Singapore Institute of Landscape Architects for your continued support of the ABC Waters Programme.

**Urban Liveability and Sustainability**

3 The ABC Waters Programme, launched nearly two decades ago in 2006, is an example of Singapore’s commitment to sustainable development. Over the years, it has transformed our waterways and waterbodies into multi-functional blue-green spaces by integrating drainage infrastructure and aquatic features with the surrounding natural landscape. These transformed spaces help to tame stormwater, enhance liveability and extend nature across our island, creating a greener living environment that bring the public closer to water. With this, it also reinforces the value of clean waterways to our people, so that they can become stewards of water.

4 This year, we look forward to the completion of Alkaff Lake, a significant addition to the ABC Waters programme. The new and upcoming Alkaff Lake is nestled within Bidadari Park and will be the second project to incorporate a multifunctional blue-green space, the first being Kallang River which runs through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. The lake will function as both a recreation cum community space in dry weather and a stormwater retention pond to slow down peak runoff during heavy rainfall, thus enhancing flood protection in the area. ABC Waters design features such as terraced wetlands and a cascading creek are incorporated to allow stormwater runoff to be cleansed before discharging into the lake. Mr Leonard Ng, the Landscape Architect for Alkaff Lake and Bidadari Park, will share more about the technical aspects of the project in his presentation later.

**Release of Updated Editions of Guidelines**

5 PUB will also be releasing updated editions of two guidelines today: the ABC Waters Design Guidelines and the Managing Urban Runoff Drainage Handbook. The fifth edition of the ABC Waters Design Guidelines highlights exemplary projects from both public agencies and private developers, showcasing innovative approaches that integrate urban liveability design features with flood resilient infrastructure. The second edition of the Managing Urban Runoff Drainage Handbook introduces a new chapter on pathway measures, offering a comprehensive overview of Singapore’s approach to stormwater management. These guidelines will serve as a key reference for industry professionals seeking to incorporate ABC Waters design features and flood protection measures into Singapore’s urban environment.

**Enhancing Public and Private Partnerships**

6 I am indeed heartened that more public agencies and private developers are coming onboard to incorporate ABC Waters design features in their projects. Since the launch of the ABC Waters Certification Scheme in 2010, 124 projects have received the ABC Waters Certification. Today, a total of 22 projects will be presented with the ABC Waters Certification. This is the highest number of certified projects awarded at an ABC Waters Seminar thus far.

7 Congratulations to all developers on receiving the ABC Waters Certification for your projects. It is through your commitment to support the ABC Waters Programme, and the tireless efforts of your teams of engineers, architects, landscape architects, and project managers, that we are able to create a more liveable Singapore today.

8 I would also like to express my deepest appreciation to the Housing & Development Board for its continued support of our ABC Waters Programme. Since 2018, HDB has been mainstreaming the Programme by incorporating ABC Waters design features in all new projects. These features treat stormwater runoff from at least 25 per cent of each development’s footprint. Out of the 124 projects which have received ABC Waters Certification, 62 of these projects were developed by HDB.

9 Today, HDB will be receiving the ABC Waters Gold Award for 4 housing projects: “Parc Clover”, “Garden Terrace”, “Parc Residences” and “Garden Court”. Located within Tengah town, these four projects stand out for their extensive incorporation of ABC Waters design elements. Going beyond the 25 per cent I mentioned earlier, these projects treat stormwater runoff from more than 45 per cent of the development’s footprint. The projects have also implemented rainwater harvesting for irrigation, and block washing. I look forward to seeing more of such projects with elements of ABC Waters design features by public agencies and private developers. I hope that those who are coming to live in this area will appreciate and enjoy the ABC Waters design features that have been incorporated.

**Conclusion**

10 With your continued support for the ABC Waters Programme, we will be able to realise our vision of a liveable and sustainable city, for current as well as future generations to come. Thank you very much for your efforts.
