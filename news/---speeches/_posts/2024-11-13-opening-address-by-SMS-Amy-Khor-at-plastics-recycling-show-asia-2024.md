#### Opening Remarks by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, at the Plastics Recycling Show Asia 2024 on 13 November 2024 at Sands Expo and Convention Centre

Ms. Melissa Tan, Chairman, Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore (WMRAS),  

Distinguished Guests,  

Ladies and Gentlemen,  

Good morning. I am honoured to join you today for the Plastics Recycling Show Asia in Singapore.  

**The Plastic Problem**  

2	Plastic has undoubtedly shaped modern industry and society, revolutionising everything from packaging and logistics to healthcare and consumer goods. Its versatility, durability, and cost effectiveness has brought about great convenience and contributed to mankind’s development. Production has exponentially soared over the decades, but there is cost to plastic pollution which we must address.  

3	Plastics, which are made from non-renewable fossil fuels, contribute to our carbon emissions when they are produced, transported, and incinerated at end-of-life. Plastic pollution, especially in the form of transboundary marine litter, is a global problem. According to OECD’s 2022 Global Plastics Outlook, in just the past two decades from 2000 to 2019, global plastic waste has more than doubled to reach 353 million tonnes annually. Yet only 9% of this is recycled. Almost 50% ends up in landfills, and nearly a quarter leaks into the environment. This means that millions of tonnes of plastic are winding up in our rivers and oceans each year. This is why countries are collaborating to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment. Negotiations are ongoing and Singapore is committed to do our part.  

4	Southeast Asia is at the centre of this problem, with six of the world’s top ten ocean-plastic-polluting countries from this region. Together, the region contributes to almost 60% of ocean plastic pollution. This is a challenge we share, and one that calls for a collective response. To protect our environment, we must strengthen our resolve to address the littering, wasteful use, and unnecessary disposal of plastics.   

**Singapore’s Commitment to Zero Waste and Circularity**  

5	In Singapore, we are acutely aware of the challenges arising from increasing waste. Our small island nation means we have limited space for waste disposal. Our only landfill, Semakau, is projected to reach capacity by 2035 if current waste trends continue.  

6	Plastic waste is one of Singapore’s largest waste streams. It accounted for around 14 percent of all waste generated last year, and around 5 percent of that was recycled. This is a stark reminder of the work we have ahead in capturing, processing, and reusing plastic waste within our city.  

7	To address this, we introduced the Zero Waste Masterplan in 2019, which marks a shift towards a circular economy approach that maximises the value of resources by keeping them within a closed loop. Through this plan, we aim to reduce waste sent to landfill per capita per day by 30 percent and achieve an overall recycling rate of 70 percent by 2030.  

8	Under our Zero Waste Masterplan, we introduced initiatives to reduce plastic waste and encourage more sustainable habits. For example, we implemented mandatory packaging reporting for businesses to encourage them to reduce packaging and packaging waste, including plastics. The disposable carrier bag charge which was implemented in July last year has led toa promising shift in behaviour, with supermarket operators reporting a reduction of 70 to 80 percent in the number of disposable carrier bags provided to customers one year on. The upcoming beverage container return scheme aims to increase the recycling rate of beverage containers, foster a culture of recycling, and encourage good recycling practices. The scheme will also aggregate clean and high-quality recyclables which can be made into new products.  

**Public-Private Partnerships**  

9	Of course, such ambitious national targets cannot be achieved by policy alone. Industry plays a crucial role in plastic waste reduction, and the government is dedicated to foster innovation within the recycling industry by supporting advancements in technology that make recycling more efficient and effective. We have funded pilot programmes, incentivised green business practices, and supported local start-ups that are pushing the boundaries of sustainable innovation.  

10	Beyond government initiatives, many industries are leading the charge by integrating recycled plastics into their products and adopting closed-loop systems that reduce waste. By embedding recycled plastic as a primary material in packaging and production, we not only create a sustainable loop within industries but also reduce the demand for resources, thus lowering our carbon footprint.  

11	In May this year, I witnessed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signing between Green Lab and Ninja Van Singapore to make eco-friendly packaging more accessible and cost-effective for local businesses. Green Lab supplies 100% compostable and biodegradable packaging to its customers, with no minimum order quantity to reduce potential wastage. Ninja Van, on the other hand supports with free last delivery of the products to Green Lab’s customers, with its fleet of electric vehicles. It is heartening that our local small-medium enterprises are working together to step up on sustainability and align with our national vision of building a more sustainable Singapore.  

12	Today, we witness another inspiring example of the start of a three-year collaboration between the Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore (WMRAS) and the Singapore Logistics Association (SLA). This partnership, facilitated by Enterprise Singapore, brings together capabilities and shared interests of both waste management and logistics sectors to reduce packaging waste, and boost circularity among logistics businesses.  

13	Under this initiative, waste materials, including plastics, will be recycled, and converted into packaging products for logistics companies. One of the key areas the partnership is looking to address is the significant quantities of stretch film and plastic wraps used in logistics. By connecting logistics firms with local plastic treatment facilities, these materials can be processed back into resin, which can then be repurposed into new packaging. I encourage companies to leverage and be inspired by this platform as you move towards your circularity goals.  

14	While these initiatives bring us a step closer to our sustainability goals, sustainable change in this sector also depends on the people who drive it. The industry’s success rests on attracting talent with innovative ideas and a commitment to sustainability. Hence, led by WMRAS and SLA, the industry is doubling down on its branding efforts to attract more talents into the waste and recycling sector. The Associations have embarked on a new recruitment video to showcase the lesser-known, technical, yet fascinating roles within our recycling industry. Hopefully, this will pique the interests of younger Singaporeans, and encourage them to pursue a career in this industry.  

15	Indeed, we hope to draw in a new generation of skilled professionals and fresh thinkers to help expand Singapore’s recycling capabilities. They can inject new ideas to further reduce plastic waste, make the recycling processes more efficient so that we can collectively work closer towards our national sustainability goals.  

**Conclusion**  

16	As we embark on this journey, let us remain inspired by the progress we have made and are making. This event is a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and dedication. Every new idea, technological advancement, and commitment to sustainable practices brings us closer to a shared future where plastics no longer threaten our environment but instead contribute to its regeneration.  

17	I am excited to witness the innovations and initiatives that will emerge from this event. We can set higher standards, inspire industries, and make a lasting impact, not only on the waste and recycling sector here in Singapore, but across Asia and beyond.  

18	Thank you.
