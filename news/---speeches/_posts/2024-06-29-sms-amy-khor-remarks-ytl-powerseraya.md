#### Opening Remarks by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, at YTL PowerSeraya's Public Screening of "The Human Element" on 29 June 2024  at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Eco Lake Lawn 

1 Good evening, everyone. I am very happy to join all of you for today’s screening of “The Human Element”, organised in support of Go Green SG.

2	I thank YTL PowerSeraya for organising today’s film screening.

**Go Green SG Returns with Focus on Public Hygiene** 

3	Go Green SG is our nationwide sustainability movement, led and coordinated by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, to encourage all of us to embrace a more sustainable lifestyle through our everyday choices and actions. 

4	Today’s documentary screening is one of over 360 activities organised by some 180 partners from across the Public, Private and People sectors.

5	We are heartened by the encouraging response to Go Green SG from both partners and the public. Several activities were fully subscribed soon after online registration started in early June. We want to thank the public for their strong support.  

6	This year’s Go Green SG is particularly significant as there are many new activities focusing on public hygiene, in support of the Year of Public Hygiene. To keep our public spaces clean, including our parks like our beautiful Botanic Gardens, it is essential that everyone plays their part: individuals like you and me, cleaners, cleaning companies, operators of premises and the Government. 

**Need for Collective Action**

7	Indeed, collective action is needed if we want to effectively and decisively combat climate change – as today’s documentary will show. 

8	As individuals, we can play our part through simple actions. Every small step, from using public transport to reducing the use of disposables, contribute to a larger impact. 

9	Businesses and corporates are also essential in driving innovation and implementing sustainable practices on a larger scale, for example, by adopting green technologies, reducing emissions in their operations and promoting sustainable products and services. 

10	The Government is also taking concrete action to tackle climate change. For example, under our Singapore Green Plan 2030, we have put in place comprehensive and strategic initiatives aimed at creating a sustainable and climate-resilient future for Singapore. For instance, we are expanding our public transport networks to encourage more green commutes and stepping up solar deployment.  

**Conclusion**

11	In conclusion, I would like to summarise the most important takeaway. You and me – we each have a part to play – whether to safeguard public hygiene or to combat climate change. Individually and as one, we must acknowledge our role in shaping the environment and take decisive steps to protect it.

12	Go Green SG runs till 14 July. You have around two more weeks to sign up for other Go Green SG activities at www.gogreen.gov.sg. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to attend behind-the scenes activities relating to sustainability and public hygiene! 

13	I wish everyone an enjoyable and meaningful screening. 

Thank you.
