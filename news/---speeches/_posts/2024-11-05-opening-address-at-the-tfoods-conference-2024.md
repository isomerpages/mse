#### Opening Address by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, at the TFoodS Conference 2024 on 5 November 2024 at Surbana Jurong Campus

Professor Ulf Schlichtmann, CEO, TUMCREATE,

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and gentlemen,

1 Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you at the TFoodS Conference 2024 organised by TUMCREATE’s research programme, Proteins4Singapore.  

**Potential of Alternative Proteins in Building a Resilient & Sustainable Food Supply**

2 This year’s Conference is organised at a pivotal juncture. Globally, there is an increasing need for sustainable food production in response to environmental pressures and climate change. Furthermore, protein consumption is increasing due to a growing global population and rising middle class. There is an increasing consumer demand for alternative proteins because consumers are demanding for more sustainable and healthier food choices. It is estimated that the global alternative protein market as of 2023 is about US$79.7 billion. This is expected to grow to about US$209 billion by 2032. Alternative proteins have the potential to be produced with relatively less land and labour, compared to conventional animal proteins.  

3 Whether they are plant-based, cultivated meat, or derived from insects, algae, or fermentation processes, alternative proteins are emerging as an exciting frontier in food technology. We have witnessed some significant strides in Singapore.  
a. Singapore was the first country to approve the sale of cultivated chicken to consumers on 1 December 2020. Earlier this year, we also approved cultivated quail;  
b. Many companies have made their presence felt in Singapore. For example, Cremer set up a plant-based protein contract manufacturing facility in 2022, while Monde Nissin launched its Green Protein Hub in 2023;  
c. In April this year, Singapore Polytechnic launched its Future Food Lab (FFL) to bolster Singapore's efforts in creating novel food products and enhancing food security. The Bezos Centre for Sustainable Protein at the National University of Singapore was also launched in September this year to advance research in alternative proteins, backed by a US$30 million grant from the Bezos Earth Fund; and  
d. Efforts are also underway to expand the talent pool for the sustainable food industry. The Technical University of Munich Asia’s 2-year Master of Science in Sustainable Food programme aims to equip students with a blend of technical knowledge and strategic skills in food science, food safety, and sustainability practices. Conducted in Singapore, the programme admitted its inaugural cohort of students in August this year.  

**Challenges of Alternative Proteins as Food of the Future**

4 Despite the progress made, challenges remain before alternative proteins can become a viable food for mainstream consumption. Let me outline three key challenges.  

5 First, cost is a significant deterrent for many consumers. Alternative protein products are often more expensive than conventional meat. This limits mainstream adoption, especially in markets with lower purchasing power. The cost of alternative proteins is likely to become more competitive as the technology and manufacturing processes mature, and its market share grows. But more can be done to lower the high production costs, such as increasing and optimising the production of alternative proteins and their components.  

6 Another challenge of alternative proteins is their different taste, aroma, and flavour, compared to animal-based products. It is challenging for consumers to expect alternative protein to taste and smell exactly like animal-based products because they have their own taste and flavour profiles based on different biomolecules present. While alternative proteins do not have to taste exactly like animal-based products, to increase the level of acceptance and marketability of alternative proteins, more can be done to enhance their taste and aroma. I am encouraged by the positive developments on this front. For example, TUMCREATE is working with Symrise to consider the use and improvement of indoor-produced plant and algae proteins for natural aroma. Food-tech company Nourish Ingredients also uses precision fermentation to replicate natural fats, enhancing the taste and aroma of plant-based chicken.  

7 Third, alternative protein companies are experimenting with nascent technologies in food production. This experimentation brings with it new challenges in ensuring product safety. The Singapore Food Agency has processes in place to ensure that novel food, including alternative proteins, comply with food safety standards before they are allowed in the market. In April 2021, Singapore launched the Future Ready Safety Hub (FRESH) to drive food safety research and development. Food safety is a joint responsibility. Close collaboration between industry players, regulatory bodies, and research institutions is crucial so that we can collectively address emerging food safety risks.  

**Engaging Alternative Proteins Meaningfully**

8 Overcoming the key challenges I have shared will require us to push technology advancements, embrace innovation, and collaborate meaningfully in alternative proteins. Platforms like today’s TFoodS Conference offers a good opportunity to do so.  

9 The TFoodS Conference allows the alternative protein industry to learn from leading researchers and academics through presentations and sharings on their latest research findings and cutting-edge technologies.  

10 This Conference also provides an opportunity to support innovation in this rapidly growing sector. A key highlight of this event is Food Sparks, which will see young scientists present their latest results to principal investigators, investors, partners, and thought leaders from around the world. With the direct participation of venture capitalists, I hope to see more investments in our emerging technology and groundbreaking concepts.  

11 Today’s Conference underscores the importance and need for meaningful collaboration to advance alternative proteins. Scientists, entrepreneurs, investors and startups have unique roles to play, and it is through shared insights that we can unlock new synergies. The cross-sector partnerships that we forge can help us to overcome the scientific and economic challenges, as well as safety concerns facing alternative proteins.  

**Conclusion**

12 Let me conclude. While alternative protein is still in a nascent stage, it has much potential to become a sustainable food option. The mainstreaming of alternative proteins by consumers will depend on how the industry can lower production costs and improve the taste of its offerings, while ensuring high safety standards.  

13 I encourage all of you to contribute meaningfully by participating in the presentations, showcases and discussions. The future of alternative proteins depends on all of us working together, across disciplines and borders.  

14 Let me wish all of you a fruitful conference today. Thank you.
