#### Opening Remarks by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, at International E-waste Day on 13 October 2024 at Westgate

Ladies and gentlemen, 
 
	Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you today to commemorate International E-waste Day 2024.
 
Importance of E-waste recycling

2	Every year, millions of electrical and electronic devices such as laptops and mobile phones are discarded as products become obsolete or are no longer in working condition.

3	There has been a global surge in such E-waste due to shorter product lifecycles and the proliferation of electrical and electronic devices. It is quite common to see a person owning and using multiple electronic devices. 
Regardless of the number of devices we own or how long they are used, it is important to ensure that they are properly treated and recycled when they are discarded.

4	E-waste contains heavy metals and hazardous substances, and improper disposal can contaminate the environment and harm public health. E-waste also contains metals and other materials that should be recovered for the manufacture of new products. This reduces the need to extract more raw materials.

5	Recycling is, therefore, an important way to manage the E-waste problem by ensuring the proper end-of-life handling and extraction of resources.  

Assuring Data Security of E-waste
 
6	So why aren’t more people recycling E-waste?  According to the United Nation’s Global E-waste Monitor published earlier this year, only about 22 percent of the E-waste generated was recycled. 
This is expected to drop further to 20 percent by 2030 due to the widening difference in recycling efforts relative to the staggering growth of E-waste generation worldwide. From feedback that I have received, in Singapore, data security is a key concern. This is understandable given that our devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops tend to store much confidential and personal information. 

7	Due to data security concerns, those old, unwanted or spoilt electronic devices are often left forgotten in the cupboard at home.  

8	It is therefore very apt that the theme for this year’s International E-waste Day is on data security, to create awareness of how you can safeguard your personal data before you send your data-bearing devices for recycling.

9	For example, before recycling your mobile phones or laptops, remember to back up your data and log out of all your personal accounts to protect your privacy and security. 
You should also remove your SIM card and external storage media and perform a factory reset to remove all the data and files before dropping your device in an E-waste recycling bin. 

10	I am happy to share that in Singapore as required by law, all data-bearing devices that are sent for recycling at licensed recyclers must first undergo data sanitisation and physical dismantling to ensure that these devices are recycled in a secure manner. I hope that this provides you with the assurance and confidence that your E-waste can be recycled securely. 

11	I encourage you to visit the exhibition area for more information on how you can recycle your E-waste securely. You can also drop off your E-waste for recycling in exchange for instant prizes.




International E-waste Day 2024 event

12	As the opening satellite event for Clean & Green Singapore (CGS), today’s International E-waste Day event recognises the efforts of the stakeholders who have contributed to E-waste management and the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme in Singapore. We will also be presenting Certificates of Appreciation to the Town Councils today for the key role they have played in the collection of bulky E-waste from households and their help in organising E-waste collection drives in their respective housing estates. I thank them for their continual support. 

13	We also want to recognise participants of the inaugural community E-waste recycling drive, where Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), community and interest groups got together to participate in a 1-day collection drive to raise awareness and spur the community to recycle their E-waste. Through their efforts, a total of close to 950kg of E-waste was collected.  
14        It is encouraging to know that more organisations are stepping up efforts to promote sustainable E-waste management. For instance, electronics store Gain City is running their Go Green campaign alongside the International E-waste Day. Besides creating awareness of how E-waste is properly disposed off and recycled, rebates were offered to customers who traded in their old appliances. Sony, a producer of electrical and electronic equipment, is also raising awareness through organising educational talks on E-waste recycling for our next generation. Both organisations have set up booths today at the exhibition area, and I look forward to visiting them later. 

Update on Extended Producer Responsibility scheme for E-waste and ALBA free doorstep bulky E-waste collection

15	This marks the third year since NEA implemented the EPR Scheme for E-waste management.

 The total amount of E-waste collected has increased steadily from 3,500 tonnes in February 2022 to more than 22,300 tonnes as of September 2024. There is also an increase from 300 collection points to about 870 collection points located across Singapore in places such as electronics stores, shopping malls, community centres, supermarkets, as well as government and commercial buildings. 

16	We are continuing to do more. To make it even more convenient to recycle E-waste, ALBA, NEA’s appointed Producer Responsibility Scheme Operator or PRS Operator, will be offering free doorstep collection of bulky E-waste such as refrigerators, air-conditioners, washing machines, dryers and televisions for all households across Singapore starting 2025. This is in addition to existing E-waste collection avenues such as the Retailers’ 1-for-1 (pronounced as “one for one”) Takeback Scheme and the Town Councils’ bulky waste removal service. 
I strongly encourage everyone to make full use of these free services to get rid of your unwanted large household appliances at home!

Conclusion 

17	As we commemorate International E-waste Day, let’s all do our part on the E-waste recycling journey because proper management of E-waste contributes to a Clean and Green Singapore. 

18	Today’s International E-waste Day event kickstarts this year’s CGS campaign. There will be a few more events in the coming weeks leading up to the flagship event, CGS Day, which will be held on 3 November 2024. CGS aims to inspire Singaporeans to care for and protect our environment by adopting a clean, green, and sustainable lifestyle. Each of us can adopt greener practices, champion a sustainable way of life, and contribute to a more gracious society.

19	I would once again like to express my heartfelt congratulations to all the award recipients. By playing our part to recycle our E-waste responsibly, we can build a greener and more sustainable Singapore. 
 
Thank you.
