Distinguished Alumni and Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen

A good evening to all. It is my privilege to join you today to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of HCJC.

1 The past few years have been challenging for the world, and for Singapore. Global geopolitical tensions continue to brew. The Ukraine-Russia war which has gone on for two years, and now, the conflict in the Middle East. The US and China continue to contest for power, with their rivalry affecting every country and region in the world. 

2 Climate change continues to affect our lives in big and small ways. We are experiencing warmer temperatures globally and receiving frequent reminders of climate change through unprecedented weather events in cities and countries around the world. Global economic growth remains below average due to the geopolitical tensions and climate impacts. Disruptions to global trade and supply chains have led to global inflation, and consequentially, in Singapore as well.  

**Forward SG**

3 As an open economy and small city-state, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to what happens beyond our shores. As the world becomes increasingly volatile and uncertain due to geopolitical tensions and rising prices, Singapore needs to look ahead, prepare for change and remain steadfast in solidarity with one another, particularly with the less fortunate and less abled among us. This is why Prime Minister Lawrence Wong embarked on the Forward SG exercise – to engage Singaporeans and identify key elements to build our shared future and robust social compact for a better Singapore.   

4 Education has been a key part of Singapore’s transformation since our independence. It has been and still is the biggest and most effective social levellers for our society. A good education system has enabled our citizens to progress, and Singapore to prosper as a nation. In the early years of our history, community groups were heavily involved in the provision of education. Schools like St. Margaret, Anglo Chinese School and Ai Tong School traced their creations to religious organisations and ethnic community groups. Hwa Chong JC and its affiliates were no different. Where there was a gap in social services, the community and the people stepped up to fill the gap.  

5 From the provision of basic education, we have seen how the schools have broadened scope to include sports, arts, social skills and morality.  Chinese High and Nanyang Girls’ High were pioneers in these fields, providing well-rounded education to their students for more than a century. In the past few decades, we have seen mounting anxiety about academic results, exam scores and pressure to get into the ‘right’ schools, which has eroded the joy of learning. This applies to both the students and their parents.  

6 This must change. Moving forward, we wish to see a society that values and celebrates individuals for who they are and what they can achieve, and a society that benefits many and rewards a wide variety of talent. We want to move away from narrowly focusing on academic performance and paper qualifications, to embrace a wider definition of success to appreciate and respect a diversity of talents and competencies. One where our students are able to fulfil their potential across diverse areas, without having to fit into a “mould” for success.  

7 The future of jobs and economy require diversity and multiplicity of strengths and skills in our people. Fundamental morality remains important. The future ahead of us require our youths to be grounded with strong virtues as they navigate disinformation, disintermediation, and disruptions. Social skills such as working with people of diverse backgrounds, empathy for those that are less abled and a strong sense of duty to the family and society are critical as we reaffirm our social compact as a nation.  

**Pay it forward**

8 As we journey on, everyone needs to recognise that we each have a meaningful stake in society, and we are all invested in one another and in our shared future. Singaporeans can contribute their fair share to the common good, and those who are fortunate to do well in life should willingly contribute more to uplift their fellow citizens with less. Our generation has benefitted from the hard work and sacrifices of the previous generations, and it is now time for us to pay it forward.  

9 There are many ways for us to do so. As individuals, we can give back through financial donations, contribute our knowledge and experience through mentorship programmes, or working with community organisations and volunteer groups. Business owners can play your part by investing in your employees and providing a work environment that enables them to thrive, so that they can do more to give back to the community. We need our work places to be pro-family, supportive of life-long learning and employment as the society faces an aging population and falling marriage and birth rates.  

**HCJC**

10 As we gather here tonight, I am filled with a sense of nostalgia and gratitude. I have benefitted greatly from my time in Hwa Chong. As a Student Councillor, I spent many days and late nights organising events and cheering for our school athletes. Through the many hours spent in the Council Room, I have made many good friends whom I still keep in touch with today. My participation in competitive sport (kayaking) and performing art (dance) has also influenced my life. These experiences served as building blocks in my personal journey, and has instilled in me the values of resilience, determination, and integrity that continue to guide me to this day, in my work and life. For this, I am grateful to the school, teachers and friends who have shaped and supported me.  

**Appreciation towards HCJC Alumni**

11 The 50th anniversary of HCJC is a significant milestone for every member of the Hwa Chong family to mark our appreciation and reaffirm the school spirit of our alma mater. I would like to acknowledge the Alumni for their unwavering support and dedication. From financial assistance, career guidance to mentorship and work attachments, the Alumni has supported our juniors and demonstrated what it means to give back to the school.  To date, the HCJC Alumni has disbursed nearly $900,000 since 2009 and benefitted over 900 students through the HCJC Alumni Student Education Fund (SEF). I would like to take the opportunity to urge fellow Hwa Chongians to support the SEF and our juniors.  

12 As we move forward, let us continue to uphold the vision of our alma mater – Live with Passion, Lead with Compassion. Happy Anniversary HCJC. May the alumni and Hwa Chong Institution continue to soar to greater heights.  

13 Thank you.
