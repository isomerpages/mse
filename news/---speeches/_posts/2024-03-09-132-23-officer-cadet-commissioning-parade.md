#### Speech by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, at the 132/23 Officer Cadet Commissioning Parade on 9 March 2024

Graduands of the 132/23 Officer Cadet Course,

Parents and Distinguished Guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

A very good evening to all soldiers on parade, and to their families and friends who are here to celebrate this milestone.

2 When I was preparing for this speech, I consulted my sons, who have completed their National Service, and several esteemed colleagues, many of whom were high-ranking officers in the SAF. They advised me to keep this speech short as the soldiers have one thing and only one thing on their minds – to quickly reach the command to fall out, celebrate with their mates, and take photos with their loved ones. So I will take their advice and do just that.

**Congratulations to Graduands**

3 Let me begin by congratulating all graduands. You have made it through 38 weeks of rigorous training and learnt many vocational skills to perform your military roles. You have been through numerous challenges designed to stretch you physically and mentally, to prepare you for the leadership responsibilities that lie ahead. And these qualities will serve you well for the rest of your lives. I will speak about this later. An exciting and challenging world awaits you in your next phase of service!

**Challenging Global Environment and Evolving Warfare**

4 Indeed, the global environment is an increasingly challenging one. The war between Russia and Ukraine has gone on for over two years now. The raging conflict between Israel and Hamas threatens to spill over to the larger Middle East region. Attacks on vessels in the Red Sea have disrupted shipping and global trade.

5 These conflicts remind us that sovereignty and international order are not a given despite the presence of international law. While diplomatic solutions remain the primary way to resolving conflicts and disputes, we need a strong and capable SAF to underwrite our defence and provide our people with the peace of mind to go about their daily lives. In turn, the SAF and National Service must have the continued support of Singaporeans – from family members (parents, spouses, children) to employers and colleagues. A whole-of-nation approach to defence is how we can be stronger and better prepared. This is especially poignant as Total Defence commemorates its 40th anniversary this year.

6 The ongoing conflicts have also given us some lessons on the evolving nature of warfare. We saw technologies such as drones, artificial intelligence (AI including deep fakes), and the Internet of Things (IoT) being used to advance conventional, cyber, and information warfare. The increasingly sophisticated and prevalent use of AI and IoT technologies means that we will be more vulnerable to its malicious use during wartime. That said, we have also seen that technology alone will not win you the war. Instead, the balance of power has often tipped in favour of the side that is more innovative and savvier with the adoption, integration, and adaptation of technologies into conventional arms and tactics. We have also seen how a nation with a much smaller population and fewer military resources could take on their much bigger opponent, with fighting spirit, will power, and better logistical capabilities.

**A Strong SAF**

7 I am glad to note that the SAF will continually sharpen its capabilities and build new ones to meet the demands and challenges of the future.

8 And it will validate leading-edge capabilities through realistic training scenarios, such as in Exercise Forging Sabre, where the Army and Air Force worked with the Digital & Intelligence Service to validate the sense-and-strike capabilities. Collectively, these capabilities and exercises maintain high levels of operational readiness for Singapore’s defence.

**Personal Attributes of OCS Graduands**

9 Now, back to the lifelong qualities that you will take away from here. Your training does not end here. As you carry out your duties as commissioned officers of the SAF, you will be assigned responsibilities that will test your ability to lead. You will face situations that will require you to overcome your fears, hesitations, and limitations. You will have to learn to inspire others. You will have to take care of your men, so that they can complete the mission. These are wonderful opportunities for developing oneself.

10 When I asked around, “What does OCS mean to you?”. I was offered many reflections – leadership, physical condition (they were their fittest in OCS), mental strength (overcoming failures, injuries, coping with stress), managing their men. Many of them talked about the friendships they made, that lasts a lifetime, including with those from overseas (New Zealand, the Philippines in this batch). One of them referred to something that should become a lifelong habit – “Make Your Bed”. Admiral McRaven of the United States made this now famous quote in 2014 – “If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed”. He argued that if you make your bed, you would have finished your first task of the morning, which will encourage you to move on to the next. It gives you a sense of accomplishment that will put you in a positive mindset for other tasks. It is about discipline, a quality that often leads to success. Some psychologists claim that a well-made bed makes for better sleep at night. My colleague gave it a twist – even if you have had a bad day, you know you will come home to a nice bed, with neatly arranged sheets and blanket waiting for you. And as a mother of 3, I will say that making your bed will make your mother very happy too! So continue to make your beds, keep up with your course mates, and take on the tasks ahead with confidence. Remember the OCS motto “Duty, Honour, Country” dictating what you ought to be, what you can be, and what you will be.

11 Thank you and once again, congratulations!
