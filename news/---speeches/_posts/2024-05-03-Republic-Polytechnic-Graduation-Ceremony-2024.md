Distinguished Guests, Parents and Graduates

Ladies and gentlemen,  

1 A very good afternoon to all of you. It is my pleasure to join you at the Republic Polytechnic (RP)'s Graduation Ceremony for graduates from the environmental and agri-tech courses as well as Distinguished Award winners.

2 My heartiest congratulations to all graduates as well as the seven Distinguished Award recipients. Let’s first give them a round of applause!

3 Well done everyone on your excellent achievement! Your family, friends and lecturers must be very proud of what you have achieved. They have supported you throughout your journey and many of them are here today. So please also join me in thanking them with a big round of applause!

4  Today marks the culmination of your meaningful journey in RP. As you look back at what you have achieved with pride, I would like to also encourage you to look forward to the future that you will be a pivotal part of. You have all been equipped with the knowledge and skills to play a part in Singapore’s shared future, including our collective efforts to be greener and more sustainable. 

5  In fact, the RP campus itself is a testament to the institution’s commitment to sustainability. Designed in harmony with nature, your ‘Campus in the Park’ concept has been intrinsic to the architecture and ethos of RP since inception. From the development of the RP Rain Garden, an outdoor learning facility, to your Platinum Super Low Energy certification by the BCA, RP is an inspiring example of how institutions can be stewards of our environment.

6  To the graduates today, let me share with you three thoughts or imperatives that I hope you will carry with you as you embark on the next exciting chapter of your lives. 

**Be Open to Innovation**

7  First, I encourage you to stay abreast of technological advances and be always open to innovation. Sustainability is an area with numerous intractable challenges needing to be solved, and innovation is an important enabler to finding the solutions. The pace of sustainability innovation is gaining momentum, with new technologies being developed. For example, some of you would have spent time in RP’s STAR Lab, the first cloud-based lab in an Institute of Higher Learning in Singapore. Such technology may have been seen as a pipedream just a decade ago, but is now becoming increasingly common in countries all over the world. We need to leverage technology and innovation to be more efficient and effective in what we do.

8  The spirit of innovation is exemplified by a team of Diploma in Environmental and Marine Science students who received the Merit Award at Sembcorp Marine’s Green Wave Environmental Care Competition last year. Nandhini, Amnah, Alya and Adawiyah leveraged the black soldier fly bioconversion method to process large amounts of food waste collected from hotels, restaurants, food courts and hawker centres around Singapore. This initiative, which represents a sustainable closed-loop approach to waste management, showcases the team’s pioneering spirit to contribute innovative solutions to global problems. As Steve Jobs, founder of Apple said, “Amidst the rapidly changing world, innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity – not a threat.”

**Collaborate for Greater Impact**

9  The second is to collaborate for greater impact. There is a saying, “None of us is as smart as all of us.” Some of you have partnered with industry players on projects under the Singapore Food Story R&D programme to strengthen our food resilience. Graduates from the School of Applied Science – Haziq, Jerral, Malik, Farid and Hermanshah worked with local companies Singapore Agrotechnologies and Kalera Singapore to develop a solution to extend the shelf life and increase the growth and nutritional quality of fresh produce. Such collaborations not only advance our local agritech R&D ecosystem, but also support Singapore’s ‘30 by 30’ vision to sustainably produce 30% of our nutritional needs locally by 2030.

10  Another example of collaboration is the team of Diploma in Environmental and Marine Science students who worked closely with the Sembawang Town Council and NParks to develop the Sembawang Nature e-Guidebook. Aaron, Manvith, Lumin, Xin Yi, Kayden, Azrul and Yeow Peng spent much effort documenting and taking photos of the various wildlife, flora and fauna in Sembawang for their project. Their e-guidebook also contains useful information on the parks and nature trails in the town, providing residents and the wider community an invaluable resource to help them appreciate and protect our natural heritage. For those who live in Sembawang, please use the e-Guidebook and enjoy the nature in your town.

11  We recognise the efforts of our graduates who have shown an exemplary commitment to collaboration and community engagement. Lau Min Hann from the Diploma in Aerospace Engineering is the recipient of the Board of Governors Award for the Most Outstanding Graduate of the Year. Min Hann embodies the essence of collaboration and positive impact through his role as the President of the RP Student Council and Secretary-General of the OneRP Community. He also collaborated with government agencies under the Future Leaders Series project to organise a Parliament learning journey and dialogue with the Speaker of Parliament. Additionally, Min Hann represented RP on the REACH Youth Advisory Panel and actively engaged the community through grassroot activities. 

12  Like Min Hann, you can play an active role in the community by supporting Go Green SG, our annual national sustainability movement that will take place later this year. Through participating in these programme and activities, youths like yourselves and members of the public can learn and commit to making sustainability a way of life! 

**Continuous Learning**

13  My third and final thought is this: Never stop learning. New technologies, businesses and production models are emerging rapidly. To stay relevant in the future economy, we must not only develop skills constantly, but also strengthen our mindset to adapt and thrive in this fast-paced world.

14  In the field of Environmental and Marine Science, Choo Ruirong stands out as the valedictorian who has not only excelled academically but has also displayed a profound commitment to learning and sharing his knowledge. Driven by his conviction to contribute to those around him, Ruirong proactively participated in study sessions to assist and mentor his peers, and conducted environmental sustainability workshops that extend beyond the classroom. I wish Ruirong all the best in his future endeavours and may he continue to serve our community!

15  I am also happy to see students from the Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses here with us today. Going back to school as a mid-career professional is never an easy decision but these students took a leap of faith to embark on new careers.

16  One example is Gayathiri, who graduates with the Specialist Diploma in Environmental and Corporate Sustainability – a programme that was launched last year. We are seeing the first batch of graduates this year. Gayathiri made a significant career pivot into the field of sustainability, showing us that it is never too late to follow one’s passion. While returning to student life after seven years posed initial challenges, it gave her an opportunity to grow not only personally, but also professionally. Gayathiri’s time at RP equipped her with new knowledge in important areas including carbon footprint management and sustainability reporting, which she can apply in her company, RubberWay. Gayathiri's experience underscores the importance of continuous learning and adaptation, and she is a role model to us all.

17  I am heartened that RP is committed to driving lifelong learning and responding to the emerging demands of the future low carbon economy through creating industry-relevant courses. All of us must embrace lifelong learning as our secret weapon to stay relevant and thriving.

**Conclusion**

18  In conclusion, there are many exciting and rewarding pathways that lie ahead of you. The sustainability sector is a growing one brimming with opportunities. More importantly, it is one that encourages you to find greater purpose and to make a positive impact on the world around us. 

19  As you embark on the next phase of life, the skills and knowledge that you have gained during your time at RP will stand you in good stead. Whether you remain in the environmental or other sectors, many of the skills and knowledge that you have acquired through the courses in RP are transferrable. In fact, all sectors now require people with sustainability mindset. When you strive to innovate, collaborate with others, and embrace continuous learning, I am confident that you will find meaning and success in your chosen path. To quote Winston Churchill, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts.” Once again, my heartiest congratulations once again to all graduating students and your families! 

20  Thank you very much.
