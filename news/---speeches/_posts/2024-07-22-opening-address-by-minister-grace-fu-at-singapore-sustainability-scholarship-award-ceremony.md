#### Opening Remarks by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Minister-in-charge for Trade Relations, at Singapore Sustainability Scholarship Award Ceremony on 22 July 2024 at MSE Hall

Scholarship Recipients

Ladies and Gentlemen

Good afternoon

1 It is my pleasure to join all of you for this year’s Singapore Sustainability Scholarship Award Ceremony.

2 I am glad to meet our young Singaporeans here today who are pursuing a career in environmental sustainability. Congratulations to our newest scholarship recipients! A warmwelcome to our MSE family! Today, we also have our in-service scholars here with us. Theyhave contributed well to their respective organisations and have been selected to develop themselves further in their areas of expertise. Our in-service scholarship is a testament to MSE family’s commitment to continually develop and nurture our officers along the course of their careers. Each generation of scholars plays a crucial role in advancing MSE family’s mission and vision. In the same way, we are committed to nurturing and preparing future scholars to ensure they are well-equipped to continue and build on the progress made by their predecessors.

**Singapore’s Sustainability Journey**

3 Singapore is regarded as one of the cleanest and greenest cities in the world. Our sustainable development strategies over the years have helped to lay a good foundation upon which our economic and social achievements today are anchored. But we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.

4 Climate change and its impacts are increasingly felt in Singapore and around the world. Sea levels are rising and extreme weather events have increased in both frequency and intensity. We are seeing hotter weather, heavier rainstorms and longer drier periods. Being a low-lying island state, Singapore is especially at risk. Climate change can disrupt global supply chains and threaten our food and water supply.

**MSE Family Scholars in Diverse Areas of Work**

5 Multi-disciplinary expertise is required to address the increasingly complex environmental challenges of our time. Through the Singapore Sustainability Scholarship, we hope to nurture future leaders to strengthen Singapore’s climate, economic and resource resilience. We need officers with: deep skill sets in many science and technical areas, and the ability to bridge different disciplines, lead project teams and communicate effectively with our stakeholders.

**Singapore Sustainability Scholarship recipients**

6 This year, we are awarding scholarships to 17 outstanding individuals to pursue courses in earth and planetary science, molecular and cell biology, alongside other science and engineering disciplines. Alicia The, who did an internship with NEA, found the work to be so meaningful that she decided to pursue a career with NEA. She hopes to use science to tackle Singapore’s environmental issues and create a more sustainable future for our home. Alicia will be pursuing a Master of Science in Environment Science at the University of St Andrews.

7 We also have Melissa Koi, PUB’s scholarship recipient who will be pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Environmental Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University. From a young age, Melissa has had a passion for environmental conservation. This drove her to pursue a Diploma in Environment and Water Technology at Ngee Ann Polytechnic instead of taking the conventional Junior College route. Melissa’s studies will help her learn and understand more about rising sea levels and we look forward to her contributions in coastal protection and sustainability upon graduation.

8 Some of us would be familiar with Abie Chi who represented Singapore in gymnastics. Shifting her focus to food security, she is one of SFA’s scholarship recipients this year. Abie will be pursuing a Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Her studies will equip her with necessary skills to address Singapore’s food safety challenges. Her future involvement in research projects will enable her to contribute innovative solutions from a veterinarian's perspective.

**In-service Scholarship recipients**

9 Our MSE family believes in life-long learning and committed to nurturing a future-ready workforce. This year, we have offered in-service scholarships to 13 of our officers from MSE, NEA, PUB and SFA.

10 Ackburally Mohammad Djamil is from NEA’s Vector Control Operations Division. He is responsible for designing strategies and executing plans to keep vector population low in Singapore. He will be pursuing a Master of Public Health at the National University of Singapore. The Master programme will enhance Djamil’s ability to devise and execute current, and robust plans to control the vector population.

11 Faisal Ahmad oversees PUB’s Smart Operations Division in its Infotech and Digitalisation Department, and implements enterprise digitalisation projects to build a future-ready PUB. Faisal will be pursuing a Master in Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Development at University College London. He hopes to better integrate AI into PUB’s core operations.

12 Ong Yihang is from SFA’s Urban Food Solutions Division and he is exploring the production of microalgae-based single-cell protein as a sustainable feed ingredient for Asian seabass. Yihang will pursue a Master of Engineering (Chemical and Biomedical Engineering) at the Nanyang Technological University. His work will pave the way for further research and innovation in sustainable protein sources for our aquaculture industry.

13 While our scholars may come from diverse backgrounds, they have in common a passion for our shared commitment to build a more environmentally sustainable and resilient future for Singapore. Our MSE family’s Singapore Sustainability Scholarship and in-service scholarship offer curious minds and passionate individuals the opportunity to pursue their dreams and develop their capabilities to help Singapore navigate the increasingly complex climate challenges ahead of us.

**MSE Family Employee Value Proposition**

14 MSE family’s recently updated Employee Value Proposition is “Our Sustainability, Our Resilience, Our Everyday”. This proposition aptly reflects our shared mission to drive sustainability initiatives, enhance water, food and climate resilience, to improve the everyday lives of Singaporeans. One of our core promises is to enable our officers to do work rooted in purpose. The earlier examples I shared demonstrate how our scholars and officers can make a direct and meaningful impact by securing the food we eat, the water we drink and the environment we live in. Our work can be challenging, but at the same time, fulfilling and satisfying knowing that what we do contributes towards a greater mission of making our nation a better and liveable home for our current and future generations.

15 Innovation is another core value of ours. In the face of an uncertain future and global changes, we must remain forward-thinking and seek new solutions to address evolving challenges. We are dedicated to our officers’ continuous growth and learning.

16 As a team, we look out for one another and strive towards an inclusive, safe and supportive MSE family that values our staff and prioritises workplace safety and health.

**Conclusion**

17 Let me conclude by once again congratulating all our scholars. Today is a significant milestone for all of you, and you would not be where you are today without the support of your family and loved ones along the way. Do also take time to reflect on the support and guidance you have gained from your teachers and colleagues.

18 The journey ahead can be both challenging and exciting for the MSE family as we press on in tackling a wide range of challenges - from public health, carbon mitigation, coastal protection, circular economy, as well as food and water security.

19 I look forward to your contributions to help build a green and sustainable Singapore. I sincerely hope that you find meaning and purpose in your career with us. Thank you.
