Distinguished guests

Good evening. I am pleased to join you this evening at the Singapore Packaging Star Awards Ceremony. Today, we come together to celebrate creativity and innovation in packaging design; and reinforce our collective commitment to sustainability.

**Singapore’s packaging waste problem**

2 Packaging is integral to businesses and consumers as it protects and preserves products and provides users with important product information. Companies also leverage packaging for marketing purposes to establish brand identity. However, as the global packaging industry grows, it becomes crucial to not only innovate but also consider the long-term sustainability of our packaging practices. This is why addressing packaging waste is important to ensure both business resilience and environmental sustainability.

3 Packaging waste constitutes a significant portion of waste generated worldwide. In Singapore, packaging waste makes up about one-third of our domestic waste. In 2022, 60% of packaging waste was plastic, while 30% was paper. The remaining 10% was made from other packaging materials like metal and glass. Singapore’s only landfill, Semakau is expected to fill up by 2035. With the domestic recycling rate at just 12% in 2022, improving recycling rates and reducing waste are essential to safeguarding our environment. This is why packaging waste is a priority waste stream under our Zero Waste Masterplan.

4 To tackle the issue of packaging waste, we introduced the Resource Sustainability Act (RSA) in 2019 and implemented Mandatory Packaging Reporting (MPR). As producers annually report on the packaging they introduce to the market, and their 3R plans, it raises awareness and encourages companies to innovate sustainable designs to reduce costs and minimise waste. The MPR lays the foundation for an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework to manage packaging waste.

5 At the core of these initiatives is resource circularity – creating a sustainable system where materials are reduced, reused, and recycled. The beverage container return scheme is an example of how we are working towards promoting resource circularity by ensuring materials like beverage containers are collected and recycled, reducing the need for raw materials and minimising waste sent to Semakau Landfill.

**Beverage container return scheme (BCRS)**

6 In July this year, the National Environment Agency issued a licence to operate the beverage container return scheme to Beverage Container Return Scheme Ltd. (BCRS Ltd.), a not-for-profit company formed by the industry to operate the scheme. This scheme, which will be launched from 1 April 2026, adopts an EPR approach to manage packaging waste. This means that producers, including manufacturers and importers, will be responsible for the collection and end-of-life management of the products they put on the market.

7 At steady state, our target is for 80 per cent of all beverage containers to be collected for recycling annually through this scheme. Based on our earlier estimates that around 1 billion beverage containers are put to market annually, this equates to around 800 million containers.

8 BCRS Ltd. will be responsible for establishing a network of over 1,000 conveniently placed return points across Singapore. These return points will play a crucial role in ensuring the success of the scheme by making it easy and convenient for consumers to return their used beverage containers. The scheme is expected to aggregate a stream of clean and high-quality recyclables, diverting these recyclable materials away from incineration and landfill.

9 The beverage container return scheme is more than just a recycling initiative; it is a crucial step towards ingraining a culture of recycling in Singapore and encouraging Singaporeans to adopt more sustainable habits.

**Alliance for Action (AfA) on Packaging Waste Reduction for E-commerce**

10 Tackling packaging waste requires the collective efforts of all stakeholders, beyond the public sector.

11 I am heartened that the industry is making significant moves to reduce waste and catalyse the shift towards a circular economy. Last month, the Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) and Singapore Post (SingPost) launched a new Alliance for Action (AfA) on Packaging Waste Reduction for the E-commerce Sector, supported by the National Environment Agency and the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment. This AfA is a pioneering effort that brings together key stakeholders to develop sector-specific voluntary guidelines on sustainable packaging, tailored to the unique needs of the e-commerce sector.

12 As e-commerce continues to grow, the volume of packaging waste will continue to increase too. This initiative is not just timely, but essential, as it addresses the sector’s specific challenges while encouraging innovation and sustainable practices.

13 The AfA on Packaging Waste Reduction is a significant step forward by nudging the industry to take ownership and address the issue of packaging waste. I look forward to the development of packaging guidelines for the e-commerce sector and am confident that it will lead to meaningful reductions in packaging waste. I commend SMF and SingPost for taking the lead, and I urge other sectors to follow suit.

**Winners of Singapore Packaging Star Awards**

14 Fundamentally, businesses have to take the important step of relooking their packaging designs to consider how their packaging can be made more sustainable.

15 Tonight’s award winners are shining examples of what can be achieved when innovation meets environmental responsibility. Lam Soon Singapore Pte Ltd, winner of the Singapore Packaging Star Awards (SPSA) for Commercial Sales and Display category and the WorldStar Award, is recognised for its Bio-Home Laundry Sheet Detergent, which embodies the principles of sustainable packaging. The detergent is packaged in a compact, paper-based box, with each pre-measured sheet dissolving completely with no residue. Compared to traditional water-based laundry detergent packaged in large plastic containers, this product reducespackaging waste while maintaining functionality.

16 Recognised for its reusable pallet lid, winning the SPSA for Commercial Environmentally Sustainable Packaging category and the WorldStar Award is Syspex Technologies. With a unique interlocking design, the reusable pallet lid ensures goods are secured on pallets without the need for single-use banding or stretch wrap. This innovative product is made from durable, high-quality materials and can be reused multiple times, significantly reducing packaging waste in the logistics sector.

17 Another award winner, Greenpac (Singapore) Pte Ltd, wins the SPSA for the Commercial Transportation and Protection category and the WorldStar Award for its packaging solution for the Liquid Chromatography Instrument. Its solution includes unique handles for a one-step unboxing and reduces the amount of material used by 50% compared to regular boxes. The compact packaging design allows more equipment to be packaged, lowering the freight cost and carbon footprint. Greenpac’s contribution showcases how businesses can enhance operational efficiency and sustainability while maintaining product protection.

18 In the SPSA Student Sales Display Category, award winner Jazel Tan Jun Jie from Nanyang Polytechnic designed Justnoodles, an innovative redesign of the traditional cup noodles packaging. The new design transforms the conventional cylindrical cup into a compact standing food pouch. This saves space, allowing for more product to be shipped, which reduces the carbon footprint associated with shipping. Such innovations demonstrate how everyday products can be reimagined to align with our sustainability goals.

19 As we celebrate the achievements of all the award winners, I urge manufacturers and designers to remain committed to adopting sustainability principles in packaging. Your efforts to continuously innovate your packaging designs will help us along our collective journey towards a greener future.

**Conclusion**

20 In closing, let us remember that packaging plays a vital role not only in protecting and preserving products but also in shaping a sustainable future. By adopting sustainable packaging design and practices, we can reduce our environmental footprint, enhance resource resilience and drive innovation and growth. Proper packaging management is crucial, not just for our shared environment, but for the long-term sustainability of our country.

21 Congratulations to all our award recipients. Your work paves the way for businesses to be more sustainable and contributes significantly to our national environmental goals.

22 Thank you, and I wish you all a pleasant evening ahead.
