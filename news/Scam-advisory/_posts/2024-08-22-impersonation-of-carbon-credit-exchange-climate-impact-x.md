MSE would like to alert the public to an online scam involving the impersonation of Climate Impact X, a carbon credit auction house and exchange, whereby the impersonators would send emails to individuals that directs them to a webpage bearing the logos of MSE and other government agencies.
MSE is not linked to this scheme and a police report has been filed. Please disregard such invitations and call the Singapore Police Forceâ€™s anti-scam helpline at 1800-722-6688 for assistance.
