**Singapore, 19 September 2022** – Public engagements for Environmental Sustainability under Forward Singapore’s Steward Pillar were launched today by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Ms Grace Fu, Speaker of the Parliament Mr Tan Chuan-Jin and Senior Minister of State for Finance and Transport Mr Chee Hong Tat at the Partners for the Environment Forum held during Climate Action Week 2022.  

**Steward Pillar – Working Together for a Green, Liveable and Climate-Resilient Singapore**

2 As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, the Government will seek to engage all segments of society to discuss the challenges, constraints as well as opportunities that Singapore faces as we tackle climate change, the trade-offs that Singapore has to balance, our priorities moving forward, and how we can all contribute to realise our vision for the future.

3 The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) is inviting members of the public to share their views on how we can foster a more sustainable way of life that stewards our environmental resources responsibly for future generations. Members of public may submit their views at go.gov.sg/stewardenv. The Ministry is also calling for individuals, educational institutions and organisations to make pledges to contribute to a green, liveable and climate-resilient Singapore.

**140 Activities at Climate Action Week 2022 to Rally All Sectors to Take Action**

4 The Partners for the Environment Forum is an annual forum held by MSE to discuss key environmental issues with its partners from the 3P (People, Private and Public) sectors. The theme for this year's Forum was "Partnership for a Green, Liveable and Climate-Resilient Singapore". As the Ministry celebrates its Golden Jubilee, the Forum was a timely opportunity to reflect on Singapore's sustainable development journey over the last 50 years, and embark on discussions to strengthen partnerships for the next chapter of our journey.

5 The Partners for the Environment Forum kicks off Singapore's annual Climate Action Week, which is organised by MSE in collaboration with its partners to rally the nation to take collective action against climate change. This year's Climate Action Week takes place from 19 to 25 September, and features close to 140 initiatives organised by more than 80 partners from the 3P sectors. Members of the public can participate in activities such as learning journeys and guided tours, green challenges, workshops, dialogues and seminars, promotions and deals. Schools and corporates are also organising activities to engage students and employees respectively on the topic of sustainability.
