#### Almost 50 Agencies Involved in Efforts to Ensure Successful Implementation of Safe Distancing in Public Spaces in HDB Estates  

1 Since the start of the circuit breaker period on 7 April 2020, 3,000 Enforcement Officers (EOs), and SG Clean and Safe Distancing Ambassadors have been deployed daily to public spaces in HDB estates across Singapore to ensure elevated safe distancing measures are observed. **They come from almost 50 public agencies and include non-public servants recruited from the hospitality and aviation sectors, as well as volunteers recruited by the People’s Association and other Government agencies.** [List in Annex A.] Many others have also stepped forward to help with putting in place measures to ensure safe distancing in markets and HDB estates. These include town councils, hawkers’ associations and merchants’ associations. We thank all who have worked tirelessly over the past week, and contributed in many ways to help ensure the successful implementation of safe distancing measures in our public spaces.  

2 The EOs and Ambassadors are currently identified by their agencies’ corporate attire, staff pass and/or lanyard, or SG Clean Ambassador pass. **From 16 April, Ambassadors and EOs can also be identified through red Safe Distancing Ambassador and Enforcement Officer passes respectively. Enforcement Officers may also wear a red armband.** [Photos in Annex B] These new identifiers will help the public to better identify EOs and Ambassadors, and facilitate the work of the officers in enforcing safe distancing measures. Besides police officers, EOs are the only officers who can take enforcement action by issuing composition fines against the public for breaches of safe distancing measures. Ambassadors help to guide businesses and individuals to comply with safe distancing measures.  

3 Any member of the public found in breach of the elevated safe distancing measures, including failure or refusal to comply with directions from an EO, will be asked for his or her particulars. **First-time offenders face a composition fine of $300. Second-time offenders will face a $1,000 composition fine, or prosecution in court for egregious cases. From 16 April, enforcement will also be done for those not wearing masks outside their homes.[1]**  

4 Notices for fines will be issued to offenders in hard copy either on site, or through the mail. **EOs are not allowed, and would never ask you, to pay the fine on the spot.** Members of the public are cautioned against handing over any cash or providing their bank account details to persons who claim to be EOs.  

5 Members of the public should stay vigilant and be wary of persons who impersonate EOs to perpetuate crimes. They should always request the officer’s identification to verify his/her identity before complying with the instructions of the officer.  

6 Anyone found to have impersonated an EO will be subjected to police investigations. Under the Penal Code, the offence of cheating by personation carries an imprisonment term which may extend to five years, or a fine, or both. The offence of personating a public servant carries an imprisonment term which may extend to two years, or a fine, or both.  

7 The Government takes a serious view of and will not tolerate those who verbally or physically abuse our EOs and Ambassadors. Our officers are working hard to keep Singapore and Singaporeans safe. We will not hesitate to take strong actions against egregious offenders, including criminal prosecution. Cases of physical or verbal abuse will be reported to the police for follow-up, and these cases will be considered separately from the principal offence that the Government will be charging the offender for.  

**STAY HOME AND STAY SAFE**  

8 More than 400 composition fines will be issued to members of public who did not comply with elevated safe distancing measures in the last two days. This included two patrons who sat down and dined in at a canteen at 63 Jalan Pemimpin. Enforcement action will be taken against both the patrons and licensee of the canteen for failing to comply with the elevated safe distancing measures.  

9 In addition, on 13 April, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) found a stall owner, at a coffee shop at Jurong East Street 24, selling face masks illegally. SFA instructed him to cease operations immediately and will issue him a $1,000 fine under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020.  

10 We thank members of public who have been sending Government agencies feedback on safe distancing. Members of public may also use the OneService App, which now has a dedicated function for reporting cases where safe distancing is not being practised. The information provided will help relevant agencies identify hotspots which require further patrols. Please provide specific details and photographs of the issue when submitting feedback. We urge members of the public to only send photographs taken by themselves, and not those forwarded to them, or found online. This will ensure that the cases flagged are current, and not already addressed by our officers.  

11 The Ministry of Health’s website has a comprehensive set of FAQs on the COVID-19 situation, including FAQs on safe distancing measures.  

[1] Mask-wearing is not recommended for young children below the age of two for child safety reasons. Individuals may remove their masks while engaging in strenuous exercise outdoors but must put them back on after completing their exercise.
