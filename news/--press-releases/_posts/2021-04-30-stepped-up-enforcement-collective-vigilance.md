**Enforcement Will be Stepped Up and Collective Vigilance Remains Critical;** **15**  **Premises and 57 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

**30 April 2021** – In recent weeks, we have seen more cases of transmission in the dormitories and local community. We need to remain vigilant to stop the spread. We urge all members of the public, including those vaccinated against COVID-19, and premises operators to be vigilant and adhere closely to Safe Management Measures (SMMs).

2 Starting immediately this weekend, government agencies will step up enforcement checks at all premises, including food and beverage (F&amp;B)premises, parks, malls and other hotspots. Firm enforcement action will be taken against errant operators and individuals. This includes fines, suspension of operations even for first offences, and prosecution for egregious breaches.

**Premises and Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

3 Over the past weeks, during checks by government agencies on F&amp;B premises, malls and other public spaces, we have caught violations of SMMs. 10 F&amp;B premises have been ordered to close, and five F&amp;B outlets have been issued composition fines for breaching SMMs. A total of 57 individuals have also been issued fines for breaching SMMs in parks.

**Ten premises ordered to close**

4 Details of the offences committed at premises that were ordered to close are as follows:

a) **Hooha Restaurant &amp; Café** (3 South Buona Vista Road) allowed customers to consume alcohol after 10.30pm on 26 March 2021. Two television monitors were broadcasting music at the premises.

**Fines issued to five outlets**

5 Five F&amp;B outlets were fined $1,000 each for breaching SMMs (see Annex). Breaches included seating groups of customers less than 1 metre apart and failing to facilitate contact tracing for every customer entering the premises.

**Enforcement against 57 individuals for SMM breaches at parks, and investigation against an individual for abuse of Safe Distancing Ambassador**

6 A total of 57 individuals were fined $300 each for breaching SMMs on 10 and 11 April 2021 in parks managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). These breaches include gathering in groups of more than eight people at Fort Canning Park, and a group of 13 individuals who had booked multiple barbeque pits at East Coast Park.

7 A Safe Distancing Ambassador (SDA) and an accompanying Auxiliary Police Officer (APO) spotted a man without a mask walking around Maxwell Food Centre on 18 April 2021. As the man was not eating or drinking, the SDA advised him during two encounters to wear his mask. The man, who was believed to be intoxicated, refused to comply and hurled vulgarities at the SDA and APO. The man also assaulted the SDA and behaved aggressively when Police officers arrived. He was arrested and is being investigated for disorderly behaviour, voluntarily causing hurt, using abusive language against a public servant and breaching regulation 3A of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020.

8 The Government takes a very serious view on any verbal or physical abuse of public officers and we will not hesitate to take firm action, including prosecution in court, against offenders. Our SDAs and Enforcement Officers have been working hard to keep our community safe. They are performing an important duty. We urge members of the public to continue to cooperate with them and comply with the instructions of personnel deployed for COVID-19 related duties.

9 It remains critical to maintain our collective vigilance against COVID-19. Our sustained efforts will help avoid a resurgence in cases which could have a devastating impact on our lives and livelihoods, as can be seen in other countries.
