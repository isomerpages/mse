**14 Premises and 74 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures;Stepped-up Measures to Reduce the Risk of Community Transmission**

During stepped-up enforcement checks by government agencies over the weekend, four food and beverage (F&amp;B) premises have been ordered to close. In addition, 10 F&amp;B outlets and 11 individuals have been issued composition fines for breaching SMMs. 63 individuals have also been issued fines for breaching SMMs in parks and beaches.

**Four premises ordered to close, nine individuals fined**

2 Details of the offences committed at premises that were ordered to close are as follows:

a) **Club Peaches** (100 Orchard Road Concorde Hotel and Shopping Mall #01-100) allowed gatherings of more than eight persons and failed to minimise interaction between staff and customers. As the establishment is a repeat offender, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has issued an order requiring the operator to close for 30 days from 3 May to 1 June 2021 (both dates inclusive). The establishment was previously ordered to close for 20 days in February 2021. Nine of the customers were also issued fines of $300 each.

b) **Alive @ SG Pub** (304 Orchard Road #03-17/17/18, Lucky Plaza) allowed customers to play dice games on 30 April 2021. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, F&amp;B establishments are not permitted to provide games. As the establishment is a repeat offender, STB has issued an order requiring the operator to close for 20 days from 1 to 20 May 2021 (both dates inclusive). The establishment was previously ordered to close for 10 days in April 2021.

c) **Tangmen Restaurant** (150 Orchard Road #01-35, Orchard Plaza) served alcohol to customers after 10.30pm on 30 April 2021. As the establishment is a repeat offender, STB has issued an order requiring the operator to close for 20 days from 1 to 20 May 2021 (both dates inclusive). The establishment was previously ordered to close for 10 days in December 2020.

d) **Club Empire** (150 Orchard Road #05-19/20 and #06-20) allowed intermingling between different groups of customers. STB has issued an order requiring the operator to close for 10 days from 2 to 11 May 2021 (both dates inclusive).

**Fines issued to 10 outlets and two individuals**

3 Eight F&amp;B outlets were fined $1,000 each for breaching SMMs. Breaches included seating groups of customers less than one metre apart, playing videos for customers, and providing dice games. Two outlets were fined $2,000 each for repeated offences of seating groups of customers less than one metre apart (see Annex).

4 Two individuals at Tekka Centre were fined $300 each for failing to wear a mask when they were not eating or drinking, despite repeated warnings from Enforcement Officers.

**Enforcement against individuals for SMM breaches at parks and beaches**

5 A total of 63 individuals were fined for breaching SMMs on 1 and 2 May 2021 in parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). These breaches include gathering in groups of more than eight and entry into areas closed to members of public.

6 Before heading down to parks, please check the Safe Distance @ Parks portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest updates on visitorship levels. We request all park visitors to be socially responsible and keep our green spaces safe for everyone. The public can refer to the NParks website for the latest advisories for gardens, parks and nature reserves in response to the COVID-19 situation.

**Other measures to reduce risk of community transmission**

7 A total of 26 public premises visited by cases that are part of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) cluster during their likely infectious period have undergonedeep cleaning and disinfection. Officers from the National Environment Agency (NEA) were deployed to closely monitor the cleaning and disinfection works, to ensure that they were performed in accordance with NEA&#39;s guidelines. These guidelines have been in place since late January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was reported in Singapore, and were developed in consultation with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), to assist owners and operators of non-healthcare premises to carry out cleaning and disinfection operations for areas that have been exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19.

8 In line with tighter precautionary measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community, businesses and premises owners are reminded to step up their cleaning standards and implement measures to upkeep good hygiene, such as increasing the frequency of cleaning of areas with high contact points, as well as strictly abiding by SMMs. This is critical as a safe environment will give patrons and employees greater peace of mind, and is also conducive for business.

9 The fight against COVID-19 will be a long-drawn and difficult one. The resurgent waves of infection in overseas countries are sobering reminders of the potentially devastating threat posed by the pandemic. We must continue to be vigilant to keep Singapore safe. We seek everyone&#39;s cooperation to remain socially responsible and unwavering in our fight against COVID-19.
