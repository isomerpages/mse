#### More than 2,900 Stern Warnings and 40 Fines Issued for Failure to Comply with Elevated Safe Distancing Measures  

1 **More than 2,900 stern warnings and 40 fines were issued to members of public** for non-compliance with elevated safe distancing measures today. In total, more than 3,100 stern warnings and 40 fines have been issued since 7 April 2020.  

2 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) detected an operator illegally hawking face masks at Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 today. SFA instructed the hawker to cease operations immediately and is issuing a $1,000 fine under the COVID-19 (Temporary measures) Act 2020. Non-essential service providers must not carry out any business from any premises. Non-compliance is an offence.  

3 Police assistance was required for more than 20 cases where members of public were not cooperative when asked to leave. During an enforcement operation by the Police, a beauty salon along Upper Cross Street was found to have provided massage services without a licence during the COVID-19 circuit breaker period. Police investigations are ongoing.  

**TIGHTENED ENFORCEMENT OF SAFE DISTANCING AT PUBLIC PARKS AND NATURE RESERVES**  

4 The start of the long weekend saw a rise in the number of people going out to public spaces such as neighbourhood centres, popular markets, hawker centres and recreational parks. To tighten enforcement, more than 2,800 enforcement officers and ambassadors were deployed today. NParks staff were out in force and rostered to enforce safe distancing measures at all parks, gardens and nature reserves managed by NParks, including the Park Connector Network, Pulau Ubin, as well as parks managed by town councils.

5 Across NParks-managed gardens, parks and nature reserves, more than 720 playgrounds and fitness areas, 12 dog runs and 8 fishing spots have been closed off to prevent gathering in groups.  

6 To ensure safe distancing during peak times, NParks temporarily closed the following:  
- Access bridges at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve;  
- Access bridges at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park;  
- The Henderson Waves, and  
- MacRitchie TreeTop Walk.  

7 The Park Connector in Jurong Lake Gardens was also temporarily diverted.  

8 NParks has also tapped on technology to monitor visitorship, including the use of drones in selected parks and nature areas that are larger with more ground to cover. The use of drones also give a better sense of the density of visitors in a specific area. Aerial photographs taken by drones are reviewed every half an hour, and areas experiencing high visitorship levels will be temporarily closed in order to ensure safe distancing.  

**STAY AT HOME**  

9 Members of public must take the circuit breaker measures seriously, and not embark on family outings during this period. The elderly, who are particularly vulnerable, should stay at home.  

10 Please stay home, avoid crowds and observe safe distancing. Failure to comply will result in firm action by our Enforcement Officers.
