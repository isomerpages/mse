Singapore, 16 November 2024 – Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, will visit Baku, Azerbaijan from 18 to 22 November 2024 to attend the 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its associated meetings.

2 Minister Fu will deliver Singapore’s National Statement at the COP29 Plenary. She will also participate in events at the COP29 Singapore Pavilion, including (i) the ‘Sustaining Access to Drinking Water Amid Climate Change’ programme where stakeholders, including the World Bank Group, will discuss the importance of addressing the challenges in drinking water faced by many countries, and (ii) the ‘Singapore to the Amazon: Breakthrough in Rainforest Conservation through XPrize’ event where thought leaders will discuss the application of the winning technologies to rainforests globally.

3 At the invitation of the COP29 President-designate, Minister Fu and New Zealand’s Minister of Climate Change & Revenue Mr Simon Watts, will co-facilitate ministerial consultations on Article 6* of the Paris Agreement. Minister Fu will also participate in high-level roundtable discussions on key issues on the COP29 agenda and hold bilateral meetings with counterparts to discuss efforts to advance global climate action and strengthen bilateral cooperation on environmental sustainability and climate resilience.

4 Minister Fu will be accompanied by officials from the National Climate Change Secretariat, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Ministry of Trade and Industry, as well as officials from other agencies.

_*Article 6 agreements facilitate cooperation between countries on carbon markets, enabling the generation, trading and management of carbon credits. This can significantly scale carbon markets by boosting demand for carbon services and trading, catalysing innovation in low-carbon technology and stimulate the growth of sustainable finance._
