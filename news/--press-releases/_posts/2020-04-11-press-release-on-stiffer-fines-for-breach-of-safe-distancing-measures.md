#### Stiffer Penalties for Breach of Safe Distancing Measures from 12 April 2020  

1 We are stepping up our enforcement. From 12 April 2020, written warnings will no longer be issued to those who do not comply with elevated safe distancing measures. Members of the public, particularly the elderly who are more vulnerable, should stay at home unless you have good reason. Any member of public found in breach of measures, including failure or refusal to comply with directions from an Enforcement Officer, will be asked for his/her particulars. **First time offenders face a composition fine of $300. Repeat offenders will face higher fines, or prosecution in court for egregious cases.**  

2 Our officers were out in force again today. More than 3,100 Enforcement Officers (EOs) and Safe Distancing Ambassadors were deployed. While there were reduced crowds in parks and markets, we continue to observe too many people gathering and loitering in public places, especially in town and neighbourhood centres.  

3 More than 3,000 stern warnings and 50 fines were issued to members of public for non-compliance with elevated safe distancing measures today. In total, more than 6,200 stern warnings and 90 fines have been issued since 7 April 2020.  

4 	Police assistance was required for about 20 cases where members of public were not cooperative when asked to comply with the safe distancing measures. In addition, two men are being investigated for offences under the Liquor Control Act and COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 for drinking at an HDB void deck along Marsiling Road at about 1.20am.  

**FURTHER STEPS TO SAFEGUARD PUBLIC HEALTH**  

5 Given that wet markets continue to attract crowds, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has introduced additional measures to further safeguard public health. All members of public should wear masks when visiting markets. From 12 April 2020, patrons who are not wearing masks will be refused entry to 39 markets managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators, which are popular and attract crowds over the weekends. This is to ensure the safety and well-being of all stallholders and patrons in our markets.  

6 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has already introduced a mandatory requirement for all personnel engaged in the sale and preparation of food and drinks at all SFA-licensed food establishments to wear masks or other forms of physical barriers (e.g. face shields) in order to safeguard public health and prevent food contamination. This includes personnel at hawker centre stalls, coffee shops, restaurants, caterers, supermarkets, etc, and many of them are already doing so. SFA will start enforcement on 13 April and operators who do not comply with the requirement are liable for a penalty of up to $5,000 and/or suspension or cancellation of their licenses. Food handlers are strongly reminded that they must not handle food when they are unwell. Members of the public can report non-compliant food handlers to SFA via an [online feedback form](https://csp.sfa.gov.sg/feedback).  

7 To prevent gatherings in groups, all beaches in Singapore have been closed off as of today.  

**STAY HOME, STAY SAFE FOR EVERYONE**  

8 Members of public are urged to take the circuit breaker measures seriously. Do not embark on outings with family and friends during this period. The elderly, who are particularly vulnerable, should stay at home.  

9 Do stay home, avoid crowds and observe safe distancing. Failure to comply will result in firm action by our Enforcement Officers.
