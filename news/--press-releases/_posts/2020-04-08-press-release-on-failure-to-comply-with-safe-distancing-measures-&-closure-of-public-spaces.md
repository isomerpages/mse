#### Three Written Stern Warnings and 10,000 Written Advisories Issued for Failure to Comply with Safe Distancing Measures, Closure of Public Spaces to Prevent Congregations  

1 **Three written stern warnings have been issued to members of public** who failed to comply with the elevated safe distancing measures. One of these involved a male at Block 89 Red Hill Close who sat down on a marked seat to take his meal. When asked to leave, he moved to another table to continue eating.  

2 More than 3,000 written advisories were also issued today.[1] **In total, 10,000 written advisories have been issued over the last two days.** The majority of the advisories were issued in hawker centres, markets and across HDB public spaces.  

**PLEASE STAY HOME**  

3 All members of public should stay at home during this circuit breaker period, until 4 May 2020. Do not go out unless you need to buy food or essential items, or to see a doctor. This is to protect you, your friends and your families. If you go out, ensure you keep a safe distance of 1 metre from others, even in open spaces.  

4 **Avoid going to popular wet markets. Shop for essential items on weekdays at non-peak hours to prevent crowding.** We urge the elderly to stop visiting the wet markets, and to get others to help if they need food or essential items. This is to protect our elderly, who are the most vulnerable.  

5 As part of enhanced safe distancing, the National Environment Agency (NEA) is progressively rolling out crowd management measures to markets. Please refer to NEA’s press release on 8 April 2020 for more details on these measures and enforcement at markets and hawker centres.  

6 To address hotspots where people were observed to be gathering in groups, the Housing & Development Board (HDB) is working with Town Councils to close public spaces such as playgrounds, sports courts, and seating areas in void decks. Please refer to the Annex for photos of closure of some of these public spaces. HDB, the Singapore Food Agency and the Singapore Police Force are also conducting joint operations to patrol areas where people have been observed loitering and sitting for hours at night.  

7 Members of public are strongly urged to comply with the elevated safe distancing measures imposed from 7 April to 4 May 2020. Non-compliance is an offence. **If a member of public is found in breach of these measures, an EO will take down his or her particulars and issue a written stern warning. Subsequent offences by the offender will result in a composition fine or prosecution. The Police may also be contacted for follow-up action.**  

8 Let us all do the right thing. The health of all depends on each one of us.
