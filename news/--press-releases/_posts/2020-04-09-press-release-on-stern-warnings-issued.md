#### 153 Stern Warnings Issued as Enforcement on Circuit Breaker Measures Tightens  

1 **153 stern warnings have been issued today** to members of public, and non-essential shops for non-compliance with elevated safe distancing measures. In total, 158 stern warnings have been issued since 7 April 2020.[1] Police assistance was required for several cases where members of public were not cooperative when asked to leave.  

**ADDRESSING HOTSPOTS**  

2 As part of measures to reduce the number of areas where people can congregate, the Housing & Development Board (HDB) and Town Councils have cordoned off more than 20,000 playgrounds, game courts, seating facilities in the open spaces and void decks of HDB estates.  

3 150 non-essential shops which should not have been opened were closed down by HDB today, and stern warnings were issued to their owners. They were mainly in household and personal care trades. A total of 7,000 non-essential service shops at HDB estates have been required to close as part of elevated safe distancing measures since 7 April.  

4 By 10 April 2020, crowd management measures will be put in place at 40 popular markets which draw crowds. Please refer to the list of markets with crowd management measures here: <https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/hawker-management/announcements>  

5 Across NParks-managed gardens, parks and nature reserves, more than 720 playgrounds and fitness areas and eight fishing spots have been closed off.  

**TIGHTER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS**  

6 All members of public should stay home during this circuit breaker period, until 4 May 2020. Avoid going to crowded spaces, including markets, parks and coffee-shops. Have meals at home and if necessary, head out to exercise only at non-peak hours. **This is to protect you, your friends and your families.**  

7 **Firm action will be taken on non-compliance.** The Singapore Police Force (SPF) has conducted joint operations to patrol areas where people were observed loitering and sitting around at Yishun, Toa Payoh West, Haig Road and Boon Lay Food Centre.  

8 If a member of public is found in breach of elevated safe distancing measures imposed from 7 April to 4 May 2020, including any failure or refusal to comply with directions from an Enforcement Officer, his or her particulars will be taken down, and a written stern warning will be issued. A second offence by the offender will result in a composition fine of $300, and a third and subsequent offences will result in prosecution. In egregious cases, there may be prosecution even if it is a first offence. The Police may also be contacted for follow-up action.  

9 Let us all do the right thing. The health of all depends on each one of us.
