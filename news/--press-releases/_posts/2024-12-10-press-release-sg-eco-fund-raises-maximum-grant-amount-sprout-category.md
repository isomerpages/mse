**Singapore, 10 December 2024** – SG Eco Fund will enhance its Sprout category, raising the maximum grant amount from $8,000 to $30,000 for projects submitted from 1 January 2025 through 31 December 2025. This one-off enhancement is in commemoration of Singapore’s upcoming 60th anniversary (SG60), designed to encourage a wider array of ground-up initiatives that contribute to Singapore's sustainability goals.  

2 Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment, announced this today during his visit to the Common Space Carbon Gallery, at Vidacity in Pasir Ris. The visit showcases SG Eco Fund grant recipient Terra SG’s efforts to build the community's awareness on sustainability through a carbon-focused interactive hub. Mr Baey was joined by recent grant recipients under the Sprout category of the SG Eco Fund. See Annex for more details of Terra SG’s Common Space Carbon Gallery.  

3 The SG Eco Fund was launched in November 2020 to support ground-up projects that involve the community and advance environmental sustainability in Singapore. The Main category for grant applications opens annually from 1 May to 31 August, while the Sprout category remains open year-round, offering continuous support for smaller projects.   

4 The Sprout category was introduced in August 2021 to simplify and shorten the application and evaluation processes for projects seeking a maximum grant amount of $8,000. Sprout applicants submit a pitch deck and present it to an evaluation committee if shortlisted. This is simpler than the application process for the Main category (where the maximum funding amount is $1,000,000), which requires a written proposal.   

5 Under the Sprout category’s one-off funding enhancement for SG60, eligible applicants may receive a maximum grant amount of $30,000, for 80% of supportable cost items, for projects submitted from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025.   

6 Mr Baey Yam Keng said: “The SG Eco Fund empowers our community to take action for a greener, more sustainable Singapore. SG60 is a time for us to reflect on our shared values, and work together towards our sustainable home for future generations. With the increase in maximum funding in the Sprout category in 2025, we hope to encourage more Singaporeans to step forward in the spirit of SG60 and the SG Eco Fund, to play your special part and create a bigger impact in building our sustainable Singapore together.”  

7 Another 32 projects have obtained funding under the Sprout category for applications submitted between May to August 2024. Since its launch, the SG Eco Fund has awarded about $13.3 million to over 300 individuals and organisations. The full list of awarded projects is available at http://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund.

**About Terra SG’s Common Space Carbon Gallery**  

Terra SG is a regional social enterprise, headquartered in Singapore and set up in 2016, that focuses on sustainability and humanitarian work. Their work includes empowering people through developing and running sustainability engagement programmes, gamified experiences, gallery experiential trails, green spaces and events. Terra SG also manages the Sustainable Singapore Gallery at Marina Barrage.  

Terra SG was awarded funding in SG Eco Fund’s 4th Grant Call to set up and manage the Common Space Carbon Gallery at Vidacity, and to engage the community through gallery tours, collection drives and regular green programmes.  

The Common Space Carbon Gallery is Asia’s first carbon-focused experiential hub that takes visitors through interactive exhibits. The exhibits reveal the hidden carbon costs of everyday activities and products, from the energy used in households and the lifecycle emissions of consumer goods, to the food we eat, and the clothes we wear. By making the invisible visible, visitors are empowered to recognise the contributors to their carbon emissions and reconsider their actions.  
 
Visitors can also explore sustainable alternatives and practical solutions to reduce their carbon footprint through a first-of-its-kind interactive Sustainability Personality web-app, which guides them through missions and scenarios to challenge and broaden their understanding of sustainability and the concept of carbon.
