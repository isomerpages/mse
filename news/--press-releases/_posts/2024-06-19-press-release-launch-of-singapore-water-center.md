**Singapore, June 19, 2024** – Singapore and the World Bank Group launched the Singapore Water Center on the opening day of the Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) and CleanEnviro Summit Singapore (CESG) today.

2 Located within the World Bank Group’s Singapore office, the Singapore Water Center aims to leverage Singapore’s expertise and knowledge in urban water management to support the water sector in countries in the region and beyond. Through conducting training activities, joint research projects, and pilot studies of novel technologies, the Center is set to enhance capacity building and serve as a thought leader on water resources management.

3 The Center is a significant step forward in the partnership between Singapore and the World Bank Group, in our collective effort to ensure sustainable water solutions for countries around the world and for future generations.

4 The launch of the Center was announced by Singapore’s Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, Ms Grace Fu, at the Joint Opening of the SIWW and the CESG. The Center’s launch was jointly officiated by Ms Fu and World Bank’s Managing Director, Operations, Ms Anna Bjerde.

5 Ms Fu said that, “The World Bank Group Singapore Water Center will help bring about more innovative and sustainable solutions to address water-related challenges, and advance the realisation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6: Ensuring access to water and sanitation for all.”

6 “Singapore's journey towards water security is both inspiring and instructive, particularly for the increasing number of countries facing water scarcity due to a changing climate,” said Managing Director Bjerde. “As we evolve to better address the development needs of countries, we are committed to fostering the exchange of best-in-class knowledge. This is exactly what the World Bank Group Singapore Water Center will do. We cannot end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity on a livable planet without tackling the world’s water crisis.”

7 “The launch of the World Bank Group Singapore Water Center brings Singapore’s partnership with the World Bank to a new level and is testament to our joint commitment to help developing countries achieve their sustainable development goals and co-create solutions to pressing global challenges”, said Singapore’s Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Finance and National Development, Indranee Rajah.

8 Singapore and the World Bank Group enjoy longstanding cooperation in infrastructure and sustainable development, with Singapore being host to the World Bank Group-Singapore Hub since 2009. The World Bank Group has also been a strategic partner for the SIWW since 2012. The establishment of the Singapore Water Center will strengthen this partnership to explore new water solutions with the aim of securing a water secure future for all.
