#### 102 Individuals and 12 Food and Beverage Premises Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures; Continued Crowd Management Measures in Chinatown

As part of stepped-up inspections to ensure compliance with Safe Management Measures (SMMs) during the Chinese New Year period, government agencies have continued to conduct enhanced checks on food and beverage (F&amp;B) premises, malls and other public spaces over the past week. Six F&amp;B outlets have been ordered to close, while five outlets and 29 individuals were fined for breaching SMMs. A total of 73 individuals were also issued fines for breaching SMMs at parks and beaches.

**Fines issued to five F&amp;B outlets**

5 Four F&amp;B outlets were fined $1,000 each and one outlet was fined $2,000 for repeat offences of seating groups of diners less than 1 metre apart (see Annex B).

**Enforcement against SMM breaches by 73 individuals at parks and beaches**

6 A total of 73 individuals were fined $300 each for breaching SMMs on 6 and 7 February 2021 in parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). These breaches include gathering in groups of more than eight people and intermingling between groups. In Changi Beach Park alone, 39 individuals were fined, including 17 who were caught gathering in one group.

**Continued crowd management measures and advisory for festive period**

7 There have been heavier crowds over the past weekends in Chinatown. STB, together with relevant agencies and community partners such as the Chinatown Business Association and Chinatown Festivals Organising Committee, has implemented additional measures from 5 February 2021 to better manage the crowds. These measures include not turning on the Chinatown Chinese New Year street light-up from 5 to 7 February and deploying more Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs) and Enforcement Officers (EOs) on the ground. Since 5 February, there has been an estimated 20 per cent reduction in crowd size compared to the week before. STB will continue to work with the relevant agencies to monitor the situation in Chinatown, and will adjust measures accordingly.

8 Around 3,000 SDAs and EOs are deployed daily to enforce Safe Distancing Measures (SDMs) and SMMs at various premises and public spaces, with more being deployed during peak hours, weekends and in hotspots. We will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against errant operators and individuals. This includes fines, suspension of operations even for first offences, and prosecution for egregious breaches.

9 We strongly urge members of the public to plan visits to Chinatown and other potentially crowded areas such as shopping malls, F&amp;B outlets, markets, supermarkets and parks, during off peak hours. This will help mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission during the festive period and keep us all safe.

10 We would also like to remind members of the public that households are limited to eight unique visitors a day. Individuals should also limit themselves to visiting at most two other households per day. For the tossing of _yusheng_, masks must be worn and the _lo hei_ should be done without any verbalisation of the auspicious phrases or toasting.

11 Multiple table bookings at F&amp;B premises for groups larger than eight persons are also strictly prohibited, unless the diners are from the same household. Intermingling across different tables is not allowed. We strongly advise F&amp;B operators to double-check the reservations they have already received to ensure that the bookings are in order. We also urge diners to not try to circumvent the rules, for the sake of their loved ones and the well-being of the community. We will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action. Let us be socially responsible in observing all these measures to prevent a resurgence in community transmission.
