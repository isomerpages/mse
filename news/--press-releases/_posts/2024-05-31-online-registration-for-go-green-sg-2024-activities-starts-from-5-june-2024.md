**Singapore, 31 May 2024** – Go Green SG 2024 will be launched by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on 12 June 2024.

Online registration to participate in the activities will commence from 5 June 2024, on World Environment Day

**Go Green SG 2024 Activities by Partners from People, Private and Public (3P) Sectors**

2  Go Green SG<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> is a whole-of-nation movement led and coordinated by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) to rally citizens, organisations and the community to take collective action towards a more environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient Singapore. The inaugural Go Green SG, which was launched by then Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on 30 June 2023, saw more than 70,000 participants in over 300 activities, programmes and experiences organised by more than 160 3P sector partners.

3  This year, Go Green SG will run from 12 June to 14 July, partially overlapping with the school holidays to allow people the flexibility to participate during and outside school term.

4  Go Green SG 2024 will feature a wider range of activities related to public cleanliness, the environment and sustainability, in support of this Year of Public Hygiene. These include a beach clean-up and educational talk on clean energy technologies by the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS); plastic upcycling workshops by social enterprise and SG Eco Fund recipient, Semula; activities showcasing innovative efforts in addressing sustainability issues including an indoor vertical farm tour by Sustenir, and a tour of the first data centre testbed in tropical regions by the National University of Singapore where participants will witness cooling solutions incorporated within the testbed infrastructure and explore sustainable practices in data centre operations; as well as family-friendly nature walks and camps by Young Nautilus. 

5  The public can also look forward to exclusive events, promotions and deals in support of Go Green SG 2024. For example, Green-House 2024, a retail event by Pass It On, will feature more than 80 sustainable lifestyle brands

**Go Green SG 2024 Experiences Curated by Public Agencies**

6  For those interested in taking a behind-the-scenes look into how sustainability features in the work of the Public Service, several public agencies will be organising tours to facilities not usually open to the public. These include visits to national water agency PUB’s WaterHub, where participants will see a live demonstration on how to clear a choke in our public sewerage system, which conveys used water to our water reclamation plants for treatment and reuse into NEWater; tours to Seletar Bus Depot organised by the Land Transport Authority; and a visit to JTC Corporation’s SolarLand at Changi Business Park — the site of Singapore’s largest ground mounted solar farm.

7  The public can view the list of Go Green SG 2024 activities at www.gogreen.gov.sg from 31 May, and register from 5 June on World Environment Day. Activities will be progressively updated on the website.

**Go Green SG Jingle Galvanises Collective Action towards Good Public Hygiene**

8  With 2024 designated as the Year of Public Hygiene, related Go Green SG publicity materials aim to nudge the public to do their part for a cleaner and greener Singapore. These include a song collaboration with local artists Annette Lee and Glenn Yong encouraging everyone to take simple everyday actions including not littering, binning our trash properly, returning our trays and clearing tables after our meals at hawker centres, coffeeshops and food courts, and keeping our public toilets clean for ourselves and other users. The jingle will be released on 31 May. Viewing link: https://youtu.be/jKVtIQkIgo4.
