#### Let’s Enjoy the Festive Period in a Safe and Socially-Responsible Manner  

COVID-19 remains a grave threat and we must stay vigilant. During this festive period, we would like to remind members of the public to continue to be socially responsible by taking the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) seriously and observing them. We must not become complacent and must continue to remain vigilant; otherwise, our individual and collective sacrifices over the past year will be in vain.  

2 The Government will therefore not hesitate to take strong enforcement action against those who treat SMMs with flagrant disregard. Over the past weekend, 16 Food and Beverage (F&B) outlets (listed in the Annex) and 36 individuals have been fined for breaching SMMs. 15 of the outlets were fined $1,000 and one outlet was fined $2,000 for repeat offences. The individuals were fined $300 each. Agencies will continue to step up inspections and take firm enforcement action at F&B outlets during this festive period. 

**Dos and Don’ts**  

3 Below are some dos and don’ts to remember and observe during the festive period:  

4 At F&B outlets:  

a) Do not intermingle between groups or tables. The current group size limit of five persons will apply until 27 December 2020 (inclusive).  

b) Do not split large groups into multiple tables. F&B operators are not permitted to accept such reservations, unless all members of the group are from the same household.  

c) Wear your masks while waiting for your food and drinks to arrive and put them on immediately after you finish eating and drinking. Do remind those around you to do the same. This will protect you as dining out is an activity that involves considerable risks.  

d) If you are consuming alcoholic beverages, do finish them before 10.30pm.   

5 At shopping malls, supermarkets, post offices and stadiums:  

a) Avoid visiting malls, supermarkets, post offices and stadiums at peak hours; do check spaceout.gov.sg before you head out, to find out if your intended destination is crowded.  

b) Put on your masks properly at all times. Do not remove your masks for product testing (e.g. cosmetics, perfumes and food samples), which is not allowed.   

c) Ensure at least 1-metre spacing between groups of patrons (of up to five persons).  

6 At beaches or parks:  

a) Do not gather in groups of more than five.  

b) Ensure you are a safe distance from other groups (i.e. 1-metre distance).  

c) Members of public who wish to visit Sentosa’s beaches on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays are required to reserve entry into the beaches via [here](https://www.sentosa.com.sg/beachreservations). You may make a reservation up to five days before your beach visits. If you are intending to visit only the premises of Sentosa’s beach F&B outlets without going onto the beach, you are not required to reserve beach entry slots. However, you are encouraged to make reservations with the F&B outlets directly to be assured of a table.  

d) Before heading down to gardens, parks and nature reserves managed by the National Parks Board (NParks), check the Safe Distance @ Parks [portal](https://safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest updates on visitorship levels and temporary closures. Please also refer to the NParks [website](https://www.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest advisories. Some gardens, parks, beaches and facilities such as car parks managed by NParks may be closed temporarily in order to ensure safe distancing.   

7 If you wish to celebrate the holidays at home, keep visitors to a maximum of five per household. The current group size limit will apply until Phase Three takes effect from 28 December 2020.  

**Please cooperate with SDAs and EOs**  

8 While many may wish to meet up with family and friends, or visit popular areas for shopping or dining out, we urge everyone to avoid visiting in large groups and to adhere to the prevailing SMMs.   

9 Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs) and Enforcement Officers (EOs) will continue to be deployed across the island. They are working hard over the holidays to remind members of the public to adhere to SMMs and Safe Distancing Measures. We urge everyone to cooperate with our SDAs and EOs, who are there to ensure the well-being of our community.  

10 A resurgence of infections as seen in other countries would have devastating effects on lives and livelihoods in Singapore. The cooperation of individuals and businesses will help to safeguard public health, while allowing businesses to remain open. Together, our collective efforts will determine if we can successfully make the transition to Phase 3 and to a new normal.
