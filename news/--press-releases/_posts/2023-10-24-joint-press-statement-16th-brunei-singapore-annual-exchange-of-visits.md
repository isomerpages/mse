The Ministers welcomed the useful exchanges of information on air  quality management and initiatives, including air quality monitoring and  regulatory measures for industrial emissions.

The Ministers also noted the efforts in youth  environmental programmes and activities such as the 4th ASEAN Eco-Schools  Awards and the 2nd ASEAN Youth Eco-Champions Awards. 

7 The Ministers noted that both sides had conducted a technical exchange to  share experiences on integrating environmental considerations and assessments  in the design and siting of new developments. On climate change, the Ministers  welcomed the conclusion of the Establishment Agreement of the ASEAN  Centre for Climate Change (ACCC) hosted by Brunei Darussalam. The  Ministers also agreed to strengthen cooperation on climate adaptation and  exchanged views on initiatives to increase heat resilience in the region, such as  Singapore’s Heat Stress Advisory. 

8 The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to work with other ASEAN  members to promote cooperation in environmental protection, including efforts  to prevent, monitor, and reduce transboundary haze, as well as addressing the  impact of climate change. They noted that such cooperation was important to  achieve sustainable development and ensure a healthy and clean environment  in the region.
