#### More Staying Home with Tightened Enforcement  

1 More than 200 composition fines will be issued to members of public who did not comply with elevated safe distancing measures today. Police assistance was required for over 20 cases when members of public were not cooperative.  

2 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) detected an operator illegally hawking perishable wares at Bukit Batok on 11 April. SFA instructed the hawker to cease operations immediately and will be issuing the hawker a $1,000 fine under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020. Non-essential service providers must not carry out any business from any premises. Non-compliance is an offence.  

**GOOD PROGRESS MADE**  

3 There were significantly reduced numbers of people observed at town and neighbourhood centres today, and crowds at parks have thinned with tightened enforcement measures. For instance, the crowd at Geylang Serai Market was observed to be about 50 per cent less than a typical weekend, and queues dispersed quickly. Tekka market did not have queues and the crowd was thin. Many merchants and shop owners have also played their part in firmly reminding patrons to observe safe distancing measures. In addition, many stallholders at hawker centres and markets have been wearing masks and ensuring their patrons keep a safe distance while queuing.  

4 While we have made progress and many Singaporeans have been socially responsible, there remained a minority of people who continue to flout the safe distancing measures, and continue to gather in groups to exercise, play sports and socialise.  Members of public should continue to cooperate with us and adhere to elevated safe distancing measures. Agencies continued to maintain a strong presence of enforcement officers and ambassadors today, with over 3,000 deployed altogether.  

**STAY HOME, STAY SAFE FOR EVERYONE**  

5 Members of public are urged to stay home, and continue to comply with the circuit breaker measures. Do not embark on outings with family and friends during this period. The elderly, who are particularly vulnerable, must stay at home. If you must leave home for essential reasons, you should avoid crowds and observe safe distancing at all times.  

6 The Ministry of Healthâ€™s website has a comprehensive set of FAQs on the COVID-19 situation, including FAQs on safe distancing measures.
