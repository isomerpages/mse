**33 F&amp;B Outlets and 36 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures; Food Licences Permanently Revoked for Two Pivoted Nightlife Establishments**

Continued enforcement efforts since 1 September 2021 against breaches of Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and Vaccination Differentiated SMMs (VDS) have led to 15 Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) outlets being ordered to close, and 18 other F&amp;B outlets and 36 individuals being fined. Food licences for two pivoted nightlife establishments were permanently revoked.

**VDS Breaches at F&amp;B Premises**

2 Since 1 September 2021, agencies have checked more than 670 premises and around 510 individuals for adherence to VDS. One F&amp;B outlet, Ohms Garden (672 Chander Road, #01-40), allowed individuals without a cleared status [1] to enter or remain within its premises to consume food or drinks. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has issued an order requiring the operator to close for 30 days from 9 September to 8 October 2021 (both dates inclusive).

3 In another case, an unvaccinated individual attempted to enter an F&amp;B outlet on Sentosa Island using a friend&#39;s mobile phone, which displayed a cleared vaccinated status on the TraceTogether App. The outlet&#39;s staff requested the unvaccinated customer and his friend to leave the premises immediately and reported the incident to a Safe Distancing Enforcement Officer from the Sentosa Development Corporation. Agencies are investigating.

**SMM Breaches at F&amp;B Premises**

4 14 F&amp;B outlets were ordered to close for SMM breaches such as allowing customers to play card games in the premises, failing to ensure customers adhered to the permitted group size, and failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between groups of customers.

5 18 other F&amp;B outlets and 36 individuals were issued composition fines for various SMM breaches. These included gathering in groups larger than the permitted size, playing music or video recordings in the premises, allowing singing in the premises, failing to ensure workers wore masks, failing to ensure contact tracing was done for its employees, and failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between seated customers. Please refer to **Annex A** for details of offences, and **Annex B** for photos.

**Permanent Revocation of Licence for Pivoted Nightlife Establishments**

6 Two pivoted nightlife establishments had their food licences permanently revoked. One of the outlets had passed inspections and was allowed to reopen on 3 September 2021 with additional SMMs in place. However, in a follow-up inspection, the outlet was found to have failed to minimise physical interaction between staff and customers by allowing hostessing activities. It also failed to ensure that its CCTV was operational at all times. The other pivoted nightlife establishment had not been allowed to reopen but was found operating with dine-in patrons. Please refer to **Annex C** for details of offences and photos.

7 Agencies will continue to step up checks on pivoted nightlife establishments to ensure that VDS and SMMs are strictly adhered to. Firm enforcement action will be taken against operators and individuals who flout the measures. This includes prosecution and revocation of licences for food, public entertainment and liquor.

**Towards a COVID-19 Resilient Singapore**

8 While the Government has called on the community to reduce social activities in view of the recent surge in cases, we are observing more people visiting shopping malls, supermarkets, parks, F&amp;B outlets, markets and hawker centres and congregating at outdoor areas. We would like to remind both F&amp;B operators and patrons that strict compliance with SMMs (including VDS) is critical for the safety of everyone. Strict enforcement action will be taken against people who do not comply with SMMs, safe distancing measures and proper wearing of masks. 

9 We urge everyone to exercise socially responsible behaviour to protect their own health and that of others. Those who feel unwell or are sick should seek medical attention and stay home.
