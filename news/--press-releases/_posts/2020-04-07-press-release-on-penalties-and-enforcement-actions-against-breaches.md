#### Penalties and Enforcement Actions against Breaches of Elevated Safe Distancing Measures in Public Spaces in HDB Estates  

1 **More than 7,000 written advisories were issued today to members of public** who breached the elevated safe distancing measures, mostly in hawker centres and markets.[1] This included written advisories given to members of public at crowded markets to remind them to keep a safe distance when queuing or making payments by following the floor markings. An advisory was also issued to a stallholder for selling drinks intended for dine-in at a hawker centre.  

2 More than 2,000 Safe Distancing and SG Clean Ambassadors, and Enforcement Officers (EOs) were deployed to HDB estates across Singapore today to ensure the observance of safe distancing measures in the heartlands. The Ambassadors and EOs were deployed by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR), together with relevant agencies[2], to cover premises such as town centres, hawker centres, coffee shops, transport nodes, parks, and community clubs/centres. Please refer to Annex for photos of EOs and safe distancing measures in food establishments.  

3 Members of public are strongly reminded that they must comply with the elevated safe distancing measures imposed from 7 April to 4 May 2020. Non-compliance is an offence.  

4 If a member of public is found in breach of these measures, an EO will issue a written advisory immediately. If the member of public does not comply or returns to commit the same offence, the EO will take down his or her particulars and issue a written stern warning. The Police may also be contacted for follow-up action.  

5 Singaporeans should stay at home to stop the spread of the virus. Stay home unless you are going to the doctor when unwell, or going out to buy food and essential items, or exercising. Singaporeans should stay at home to protect themselves, their friends and families. If you go out, ensure safe distancing.  

6 We will step up enforcement and take a firm stance. Under the COVID-19 Temporary Measures Bill passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Second or subsequent offences may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.
