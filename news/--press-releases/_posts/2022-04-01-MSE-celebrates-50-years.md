**Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment Celebrates Years of Building a Green and Resilient Singapore**

**1 April 2022** â€“ The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment will commemorate its 50th anniversary this year with a series of meaningful activities to celebrate Singapore&#39;s environmental milestones, and renew our commitment to build a green and resilient Singapore.

2 In 1972, Singapore was one of the first countries to form a Ministry of the Environment (or ENV) to tackle issues such as pollution control and environmental health amidst the rapid industrialisation of the 1970s.

3 The Ministry&#39;s role, its composition, and name have evolved to address changing circumstances and reflect varying emphases over the years. In 2004, ENV was renamed the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) to better reflect the Ministry&#39;s expanded role in managing Singapore&#39;s water resources. In 2020, the Ministry was renamed the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment to reflect the Government&#39;s strong emphasis on sustainability, and our wide-ranging responsibilities in carbon mitigation and adaptation, coastal protection, zero waste and circular economy, as well as food and water security. Our efforts in sustainable development over the years have enabled Singapore to become one of the cleanest and greenest cities in the world today, providing a high quality of life and liveability for our people.

4 At MSE&#39;s Excellence Day (MED) on 1 April 2022, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Ms Grace Fu expressed appreciation for past and present staff for their valuable contributions, and said the Ministry would continue to partner stakeholders and citizens to co-create practical and balanced solutions to achieve Singapore&#39;s environmental goals. She said: &quot;As we write the next chapter, I hope to foster a deeper understanding of sustainability issues among our people and to encourage everyone to be stewards of our environment.&quot;

5 MSE and its statutory boards will mark the Ministry&#39;s Golden Jubilee with a range of videos, events, and meaningful mementos. For instance:

i. To celebrate our environmental milestones

- A **commemorative stamp set** featuring the theme of environmental sustainability
- A **short film** showcasing Singapore&#39;s transformation into a clean and sustainable Singapore
- A **short documentary and a social media series** highlighting Singapore&#39;s environmental milestones
- A **campaign** on social media to gather user-generated stories and photographs of Singapore&#39;s sustainable development journey

ii. To recognise those who have contributed to Singapore&#39;s sustainable development journey

- A **video series** to profile long-serving employees as well as lesser-known jobs in the MSE Family

iii. To continue working together to safeguard our environment

- **Tree planting events** with partners.
