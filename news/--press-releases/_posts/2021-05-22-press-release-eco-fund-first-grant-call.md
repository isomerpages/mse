#### 37 PROJECTS AWARDED FUNDING UNDER THE SG ECO FUND

_Projects will advance environmental sustainability and contribute towards the Singapore Green Plan 2030_

**22 MAY 2021** – A total of 37 projects will obtain funding under the first SG Eco Fund grant call. This was announced by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, at the Global Compact Network Singapore&#39;s Virtual Youth Forum.

2 The S$50 million SG Eco Fund was launched in November 2020 by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment to support the co-creation of solutions for a sustainable Singapore. The first grant call was opened from 25 November 2020 to 31 January 2021. Over 200 applications were received from both individuals and organisations.

3 Projects were evaluated on their environmental outcomes, and community engagement and implementation plan, among several factors. The 37 awarded projects will receive S$3.7 million funding in total. Of these, 25 projects will receive up to S$50,000 in funding, while the remaining 12 will receive between $50,000 and $700,000 in funding. They address a broad spectrum of environmental issues, ranging from waste management and recycling, to public cleanliness and low-carbon solutions. They are a mix of public, private and people (3P) sector applicants (please refer to the **[Annex](../../resources/awarded-projects.pdf)** for the full list of awarded projects).

4 The SG Eco Fund supports the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which is a national roadmap to advance the Singapore sustainability agenda. Building an active Green Citizenry, where individuals, communities and businesses play an active role for sustainability, is a key enabler in successfully implementing the strategies and meeting our targets under the Green Plan. The SG Eco Fund aims to empower everyone across the 3P sectors to take ownership of the environment and do their part to ensure Singapore remains a green and liveable home for our future generations.
