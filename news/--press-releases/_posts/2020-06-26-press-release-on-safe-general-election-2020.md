#### Advisory to Members of Public to Ensure a Safe General Election 2020  

1 Political parties and candidates can be expected to ramp up their campaigning activities after Nomination Day on 30 June 2020, in the run up to Polling Day on 10 July 2020. The Elections Department has issued [guidelines](https://www.eld.gov.sg/pdf/GE2020/Advisory_on_Safe_Physical_Campaigning_During_General_Election_2020.PDF) on how political parties and candidates can campaign effectively and safely under the current circumstances. This advisory serves to also remind and encourage all members of public to continue to observe safe distancing measures, so as to ensure a safe General Election (GE) for all.  

2 Under Phase 2 of our re-opening, all members of public are required to abide by general safe distancing measures in public spaces and premises such as town centres, markets, eating places and malls, as announced earlier by the Ministry of Health. These measures include:  

a)	Wearing of face masks at all times when outside one’s home, unless when eating, drinking or doing strenuous exercises  
b)	Maintaining a safe distance of at least one metre between individuals  
c)	Maintaining a safe distance of at least one metre between each group (of not more than five persons).  

3 At home, there should not be more than five visitors at any one time.  

4 In the context of GE2020, the required actions and best practices for members of public in line with the general safe distancing measures include:   

a)	*Encountering Candidates on their Walkabouts*  

i.	Maintain a one-metre safe distance from other individuals, such as when interacting with candidate(s), or when queuing for political campaigning items such as flyers.  

ii.	Avoid physical contact with candidate(s) and their supporters, e.g. refrain from shaking hands or engaging in greetings where there is physical contact, such as fist bumps or high fives.   

iii.	Continue to wear your face mask when interacting with candidate(s).  

iv.	Refrain from following or crowding around the candidate(s) and their accompanying supporters.  

v.	If taking photographs with candidate(s), you should maintain at least a one-metre safe distance and wear your face mask.  

b)	*Encountering Candidates on Door-to-Door Visits*  

i.	Maintain at least a one-metre safe distance when interacting with candidate(s) at your doorstep; you should also wear your face mask.  

ii. Avoid physical contact, e.g. refrain from shaking hands or engaging in greetings where there is physical contact, such as fist bumps or high fives.  

iii.	If you wish to invite candidate(s) into your home, adhere to the limit of five visitors (inclusive of any other guests who may already be in your house) at any point of time. Candidate(s) and their accompanying supporters must continue to wear face masks when inside your home. You should also put on a face mask for your protection.  

c)	*Supporting Candidates while Avoiding Crowds*  

i.	We encourage you to watch the Party Political Broadcasts, Constituency Political Broadcasts and online rallies at home.   

ii.	Refrain from gathering or loitering in the vicinity of Nomination Centres during nomination proceedings.   

5 Safe Distancing Ambassadors and Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers will continue to be on the ground to help keep everyone safe. Please cooperate with and listen to them. For the health and safety of everyone, it is paramount that political parties, candidates and members of the public abide by the above safe distancing and safe management measures. Everyone can do their part in ensuring a safe GE for all.
