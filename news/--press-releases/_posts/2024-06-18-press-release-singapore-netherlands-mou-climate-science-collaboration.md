**Singapore, 18 June 2024** – Singapore and the Netherlands signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today to collaborate on supporting international climate science research. The MOU was signed by Singapore’s Permanent Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment, Mr Stanley Loh and the Netherlands’ Water Envoy, Ms Meike van Ginneken. 
 
2 The MOU supports the establishment and work of the Technical Support Unit (TSU) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Working Group II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. The Singapore and the Netherlands Government have secured premises and are providing funds for staff and research for the two TSU offices in their respective countries. The two TSUs will provide scientific, technical, operational and communications support to IPCC’s Working Group II in its Seventh Assessment Report Cycle (AR7).  

3 This collaboration follows from the successful election of the  Professor Winston Chow of Singapore Management University and Professor Bart van den Hurk of Deltares, as Co-Chairs of the IPCC’s Working Group II, at the 59th Session of IPCC Bureau elections in July 2023 in Nairobi, Kenya.  

4 The IPCC is the United Nation’s body for assessing the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for mitigation and adaptation. IPCC’s assessments provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies and contribute to global climate action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). AR7 formally began in July 2023.

5 Permanent Secretary Mr Stanley Loh said, “The signing of this MOU highlights Singapore and the Netherlands’ joint commitment to contribute to the advancement of climate science and international climate action. Our collaboration will contribute to capacity building and enable countries to advance climate action, particularly in climate adaptation. Singapore’s hosting of the TSU will facilitate more effective representation and involvement of fellow developing countries in the IPCC process.”
