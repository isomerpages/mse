MSE would like to alert the public to a scam involving the impersonation of investment platform GenZero. Individuals would receive an email, or a phone text message, that encourages them to purchase carbon credits through a mobile application. They will also receive a separate email with links to a confirmation page, bearing the logos of the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), Ministry of National Development (MND) and the National Environment Agency (NEA). Upon registration on the mobile application, the individual will be asked to key in their personal banking details for payment.

This is a scam. MSE, MND and NEA are not affiliated with any such carbon credit purchasing or trading applications. GenZero has also confirmed that this is a scam. If you receive such invitation emails and would like to verify its authenticity, please call the MSE hotline at 1800-738-4622.
