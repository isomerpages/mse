### Thank you for your Pledges!

### MSE's Green Nation Pledge

<img src="/images/GNP2022_MSEPledge_Web.png" alt="Green Nation Pledge">

MSE pledges to realise a sustainable, resource efficient, and climate resilient Singapore. MSE has developed a [Best Practice Guide for organising environmentally-friendly events](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resources/environmentally-friendly-events-guidelines.pdf). We will adhere to this guide and encourage our stakeholders to do the same. We consider environmental best practices when planning for procurement and operations as well as identifying new green initiatives. We encourage our suppliers to implement similar [environmental practices](http://www.mse.gov.sg/about-us/our-practices). We will continue to develop initiatives and policies under the [Zero Waste Masterplan](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/zero-waste-masterplan/) to reduce the amount of waste going to our landfill by 30 per cent per capita per day by 2030.
