<h1><b>Our Water Policy in a Nutshell</b></h1>

<p><strong>ENSURING WATER SUPPLY FOR ALL</strong><br> Singapore depends on four sources for its water supply – water from local catchment, imported water, high-grade reclaimed water known as NEWater and desalinated water. Known as the Four National Taps, this diversified water supply strategy ensures Singaporeans of a robust supply of water for generations to come.</p>

<p><strong>Weather-resilient Water Sources</strong><br> NEWater and desalinated water are weather-resilient water sources and will help strengthen Singapore's water security. </p>
<p><strong>NEWater</strong><br> We have successfully closed the water loop by recycling used water to become a high-grade reclaimed water known as NEWater, allowing us to reuse every drop of water endlessly. There are currently five NEWater factories in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Desalination</strong><br> With improvements in membrane technology, desalination has become an economically viable option for water supply. We now have five desalination plants in operation. The fifth desalination plant, Jurong Island Desalination Plant, officially opened on 17 April 2022.</p>

<h2 id="our-main-plans">Water Quality</h2>

<p>The potable water supplied by PUB is well within the Environmental Public Health (EPH) (Water Suitable for Drinking) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 and World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines for drinking water quality, and is available to all in Singapore.</p>

<h2>Ensuring Water Supply for All</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title4"  /><label for="title4">The Challenge: Water - A Precious Resource</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore is amongst the most water-stressed countries in the world. This is due to the lack of natural water resources such as large rivers, natural springs or glaciers, as well as limited land to collect and store rainwater.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title5"  /><label for="title5">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Through careful planning and innovation, we have been able to build a robust, diversified and sustainable supply of water over the decades with our Four National Taps: <br>1) water from local catchment,<br>2) imported water, <br> 3) high-grade reclaimed water known as NEWater and <br>4) desalinated water.</p>
		<p>Water demand is expected to almost double by 2065. To meet this growing need, we have to continue planning ahead, innovating and investing in research and development of more efficient water treatment processes to ensure the long-term sustainability of our water resources.</p>

<h2>About Our Reservoirs and Waterways</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title6"  /><label for="title6">The 1st National Tap - Water from Local Catchment</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Rainwater is an important source of water for Singapore and forms one of our Four National Taps.</p>
		<p>In land-scarce Singapore, we have limited land to collect and store rainwater. To make the best use of the rainfall we receive, the water catchment area in Singapore has been progressively expanded over the years.</p>
		<p>Two-thirds of Singapore's land surface serves as water catchment area. Rainwater that falls within the water catchment is collected and channelled via a network of more than 8,000 km of drains and canals, to 17 reservoirs for storage before it is treated for drinking.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title7"  /><label for="title7">The Challenges</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Difficult to Create New Reservoirs</em></p>
		<p>All major estuaries in Singapore have already been dammed up to create reservoirs. While we still have some untapped streams and rivulets near the coastline, they are too small to dam up as reservoirs.</p>
		<p><em>Rainfall Patterns are Unpredictable</em></p>
		<p>Climate change may result in unpredictable rainfall patterns. We cannot rely solely on rainwater collected by our reservoirs to meet the water needs of our population and economy.</p>
		<p><em>Possible Pollution from Urban Development</em></p>
		<p>It is a challenge to keep the rainwater collected clean, as Singapore’s small size means that much of our urban development is near or within water catchment areas. Many human activities produce pollutants that can be carried via the drainage system into our reservoirs when it rains, affecting reservoir water quality. Urbanisation also makes our waterways and reservoirs more accessible, exposing them to inconsiderate actions such as littering.</p>
		<p>Such pollution makes it more costly to process and supply clean water to our taps.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title8"  /><label for="title8">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Keeping Our Water Clean</em></p>
		<p>Our waterways are cleaned regularly. We use float booms and litter traps to prevent litter from entering our reservoirs. </p>
		<p>We have also put in place measures to keep our reservoirs clean. For example, an underground wall was built along the former Lorong Halus landfill, which forms part of the bank of Serangoon Reservoir. The wall prevents water from the landfill from seeping into the reservoir. Instead, this water is collected and treated on-site by passing them through specially selected reed beds and ponds, before it is discharged into the sewerage system.</p>
		<p>Beyond these measures, everyone has a part to play in keeping our waterways clean and free from pollutants.</p>
		<p><em>Seeking Cooperation from Public and Private Sectors</em></p>
		<p>We rely on everyone to help keep our water clean. Individuals have to help keep our drains, rivers and reservoirs clean by not littering. Construction companies have to ensure that soil from worksites does not get washed into our drains, and factories have to ensure that waste chemicals are not discharged into our drains. PUB puts in place regulations for industry players to ensure that waste is properly disposed and substances such as silt and chemicals are not washed into waterways.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title9"  /><label for="title9">ABC Waters Programme</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Our waterways and reservoirs have been transformed under PUB's Active, Beautiful, Clean (ABC) Waters Programme into recreational spaces which people can value and enjoy, bringing people closer to water so that they can better appreciate and cherish this precious resource.</p>
		<p>ABC Waters design features are incorporated to create both beautiful and clean waterways for all to enjoy. These include bioretention systems that help to cleanse the rainwater as it flows through our waterways.</p>
		<p>As part of the ABC Waters programme, many of our waterways and reservoirs are now open to a variety of recreational water activities such as canoeing, dragon-boating, kayaking and sailing.</p>

<a id="imported-water"></a>

<h2>Imported Water</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title10"  /><label for="title10">The 2nd National Tap</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore imports water from Johor under the 1962 Water Agreement between Singapore and the Johor State. This agreement entitles Singapore to draw and use up to 250 million gallons of raw water per day from the Johor River. In return, Singapore is obliged to provide Johor with treated water up to 2% of the water we import. The agreement expires in 2061.</p>

<h2>NEWater</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title11"  /><label for="title11">The 3rd National Tap</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Introduced in 2002, NEWater is produced through a 3-step treatment process (microfiltration, reverse osmosis, disinfection) using advanced membrane technologies. It has passed through more than 150,000 scientific tests and is well within the World Health Organisation guidelines for Drinking - Water Quality. As a weather-resilient source, NEWater plays an important role in enhancing the resilience of our water supply.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title12"  /><label for="title12">Non-Potable Use</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>As it is ultra-clean, NEWater is used mainly for industrial and air-con cooling purposes at water fabrication plants, industrial estates, and commercial buildings.</p>
		<p>The biggest users of NEWater are wafer fabrication plants, which require water quality that is even more stringent than water for drinking. NEWater is delivered to industrial customers via a dedicated pipe network.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title13"  /><label for="title13">Indirect Potable Use</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>During dry periods, NEWater is added to our reservoirs to blend in with raw water. The raw water from the reservoirs is treated at the waterworks before it is supplied to consumers as tap water.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title14"  /><label for="title14">The Challenge: Managing trade effluent discharge</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Used water is a precious resource to Singapore as it is used to produce NEWater. The discharge of trade effluent containing prohibited substances or excessively high concentrations of regulated substances will impact the used water treatment operations at Water Reclamation Plants (WRP) and the production of NEWater. PUB monitors these discharges closely.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title15"  /><label for="title15">Legislation</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>It is important for industries to play their part by complying with the Sewerage and Drainage Act and Sewerage and Drainage (Trade Effluent) Regulations.</p>

<h2>Desalination</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title16"  /><label for="title16">Our 4th National Tap</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Desalination is the removal of dissolved salt and minerals from seawater to make it potable.</p>
		<p>Advances in membrane technology have made it viable for desalinated water to be one of our Four National Taps. In Singapore, desalination is done through a process called reverse osmosis, which separates water from dissolved salts and minerals. As desalination is not dependent on rainfall, it is a weather-resilient source of water supply.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title17"  /><label for="title17">The Challenge: High Energy Usage and Potential Environmental Impact</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Desalinated Water is Costly</em></p>
		<p>Although desalinated water is weather-resilient, it remains an energy-intensive source of water.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title18"  /><label for="title18">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Technology Provides Solution</em></p>
		<p>We continue to invest in research and development to reduce the energy consumption of desalination to ensure the sustainability of desalinated water. These include technologies such as electrodeionisation and biomimicry with the goal of halving the current energy requirement. </p>
		<p><em>Limiting The Impact On The Marine Environment</em></p>
		<p>We closely monitor the quality of sea water surrounding our desalination plants to make sure there is minimal impact on the marine environment.</p>

<a id="encouraging-water-conservation"></a>

<h2>Encouraging Water Conservation</h2>
<p>As our population and economy continue to grow, we need to manage our water demand and conserve our precious water resources.</p>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title19"  /><label for="title19">The Challenge: Taking Water for Granted</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Increasing Demand and Climate Change</em></p>
		<p>Singapore consumes about 440 million gallons of water per day, and the total water demand is expected to almost double by 2065 as a result of projected increases in industrial activity and population growth. Coupled with the uncertainty of weather patterns in the face of climate change, we must do all we can to ensure the sustainability of our water resources.</p>
		<p><em>Wasteful Habits </em></p>
		<p>In Singapore, we are fortunate to have easy access to clean water. However, this also makes it easy for us to use more water than we really need. When clean water comes at the turn of a tap, it is easy to take water for granted and waste this precious resource without noticing.</p>
		<p><em>Unrepaired Leaks</em></p>
		<p>Water wastage from pipes or water appliances often goes unnoticed. Loose tap fittings, malfunctioning toilet cisterns and leaking water pipes can all lead to a huge waste of water.</p>
		<p>For instance, a typical leak from a kitchen can amount to 10,000 litres per year, which is over 6,600 large bottles.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title20"  /><label for="title20">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Reduction in Water Consumption</p>
		<p>Through our long-term efforts in water conservation, Singapore's household water consumption dropped steadily from 165 litres per capita per day (LPCD) in 2003 to 141 LPCD in 2019.</p>
		<p>Household water consumption increased sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic - 154 LPCD in 2020 and 158 LPCD in 2021. This was a result of people spending more time at home due to safe management measures and work-from-home arrangements, and an increased emphasis on hygiene.</p>
		<p>The household water consumption returned to pre-pandemic levels of 141 LCPD in 2023, following the relaxation of COVID-19 safe management measures and resumption of business activities. We will continue our efforts to encourage water conservation.</p>
		<p><em>Water Conservation Education and Outreach</em></p>
		<p>PUB engages in community outreach efforts to raise awareness. These include the annual water conservation campaign to reinforce the importance of water conservation, and Singapore World Water Day celebration in the month of March to rally the community and drive continued awareness on the importance of water conservation and sustainability, through a variety of community and ground-up events.</p>
		<p><em>Preventing and Detecting Leaks</em></p>
		<p>PUB replaces ageing water mains and pipes over the years to minimise leaks. Regular checks are also conducted on water meter readingfs, and on water mains and pipes using technologies such as leak monitoring sensors and inline pipe inspection tools, to detect leaks.</p>
		<p><em>Pricing Water to Reflect Its True Value</em></p>
		<p>The price of water in Singapore reflects its scarcity value. The use of sound economic principles in pricing water is important to keep demand and supply in balance. Under-pricing water leads to over-consumption. In Singapore, water is priced to recover the full cost of its supply and production, and to reflect the cost of producing the next drop of water, which will be from NEWater and desalination.</p>
		<p><em>Mandating Water Efficiency Requirements</em></p>
		<p>The Mandatory Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme and minimum water efficiency standards for water fittings and appliances help consumers and businesses make more informed choices, and encourage suppliers to introduce more water-efficient fittings and appliances into the market.</p>
		<p>Large water users in the non-domestic sector are required to submit water efficiency management plans to PUB annually. This requirement encourages companies to better understand and manage their water usage, and has allowed PUB to develop water efficiency benchmarks and best practice guidelines using the data collected.</p>
		<p><em>Funding Water Efficient Measures</em></p>
		<p>PUB's Water Efficiency Fund (WEF) co-funds organisations, companies and community groups to implement water saving initiatives such as water recycling projects and the adoption of water efficient equipment. Since 1 July 2023, PUB has raised the funding cap for water recycling projects under the WEF from $1 million to $5 million, as part of its continuing efforts to drive water conservation efforts and promote the sustainable water management practices in the non-domestic sector.</p>

<h2>Our Beach Water Quality</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title21"  /><label for="title21">Beach Water can be Harmful</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Beach water is vulnerable to contamination from pollutants. During water activities at the beach, we will come into contact with seawater and may ingest it accidentally. Should the water quality be poor or contaminated, this may lead to gastrointestinal and respiratory illness.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title22"  /><label for="title22">The Challenge: Many Factors Affect the Quality of Beach Water</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Many sources of pollution to monitor: Minor leakage from older sewers, Sea Animals and Discharges from moored vessels.</p>
		<p><em>Changing Tides Present Different Challenges</em></p>
		<p>While our beaches are cleaned regularly, changing tidal conditions make the task more challenging. During the north-east and south-west monsoons, more floating refuse and debris is washed ashore from the open sea. This requires greater effort in removal.</p>
		<p><em>Beach Goers Must Play Their Part</em></p>
		<p>While beach goers enjoy their time at the beach, they should take care not to leave rubbish behind when they leave, which could contribute to the pollution of beach water.</p>	
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title23"  /><label for="title23">Our Efforts: Setting Standards, Monitoring and Cleaning Up</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Water samples are collected and tested by NEA weekly at monitored recreational beaches. These tests help ensure that our beach water quality meets our recreational water quality guidelines.</p>
		<p>Singapore's recreational water quality guidelines are adopted from World Health Organisation guidelines for Safe Recreational Waters. The local guidelines were established in 2008 after a careful study of the WHO guidelines, analysis of data gathered over a few years, and consultation and collaboration with other relevant agencies.</p>
		<p>NEA also has regular cleaning regimes for our beaches.</p></p>

<h2>Stormwater Management and Flood Protection</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title24"  /><label for="title24">Coping with More Intense Rainfall</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>As climate change brings about more extreme weather events, we are likely to see more flash floods from intense rain.</p>
		<p>We have an extensive drainage system comprising 8,000km of drains, rivers and canals that channel rainwater to our reservoirs or the sea. Most times, our drains can cope with the rain that we receive. However, intense bouts of rainfall can sometimes exceed the capacity that the drains are designed for, resulting in flash floods. These floods are mostly localised and subside within an hour.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title25"  /><label for="title25">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Reviewing Our Drainage System</em></p>
		<p>In light of the challenges posed by growing urbanisation and increasing weather uncertainties, PUB has adopted a system-wide "Source-Pathway-Receptor" approach to introduce flexibility and adaptability to our drainage system.</p>
		<p><em>Strengthening Community Resilience</em></p>
		<p>While we continue with efforts to reduce flood risks through drainage expansions, it may not always be feasible to build our drains to accommodate every extreme rainfall event as this would require massive land take and much higher costs. Everyone has a role to play in ensuring Singapore's flood resilence. Hence, we work closely with building and property owners to ensure that their premises have sufficient flood protection to minimise flood risks and keep public out of harm's way.</p>
		<p><em>Experts Reviewed Drainage Planning Norms and Flood Protection Measures</em></p>
		<p>To improve flood monitoring, PUB has installed an extensive network of water level sensors at major waterways and drains, as well as CCTVs at flood-prone areas and hotspots. With the ability to monitor real-time site conditions, PUB can provide early warning to the public and activate its Quick Response Teams to flooded areas to carry out flood management (such as removing chokage, deploying portable flood barriers) and traffic management.</p>
  		<p>In addition, the public can get timely updates on potential floods through multiple platforms such as the Telegram flood alert channel, "MyENV" mobile application, and social media platforms (e.g. Facebook and X (formerly known as Twitter)), so that safety precautions can be taken.</p>
