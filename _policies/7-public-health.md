<h1><b>Our Public Health Policy in a Nutshell</b></h1>

<p><strong>MAINTAINING A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE</strong><br>  Robust public health standards are fundamental to ensure a good quality of life. By upholding high public health standards, we create a clean and safe environment where Singaporeans can work and play without compromising their overall health and well-being.</p>

<p><strong>CONTROLLING VECTOR POPULATIONS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH</strong><br>  Vectors such as mosquitoes and rats can transmit spread diseases among within the population. Effectively  by carrying viruses from one person to another. The controlcontrolling vector populations of vectors, especially mosquitoes, is a key strategy to safeguard one important way of protecting Singaporeans from potential public health threats such as dengue and other vector-bornefrom diseases.</p>

<p><strong>PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM SECOND-HAND SMOKE</strong><br>  To protect Singaporeans from the harmful effects of second-hand tobacco smoke, the smoking ban was introduced in October 1970 and has been progressively extended to cover many public places over the years.</p>

<p><strong>STRENGTHENING PUBLIC HEALTH RESILIENCE THROUGH PUBLIC CLEANLINESS AND HYGIENE <i>[NEW]</i></strong><br>  Ensuring clean public spaces is important to prevent the spread of diseases and safeguard the overall well-being of the community. Upholding high standards of public cleanliness and hygiene, contributes towards strengthening our resilience against public health threats in the long term.</p>

<h2 id="our-key-targets">Our Key Outcomes</h2>
<ol>
	<li><p>Maintain a low incidence of vector-borne diseases and become a leading regional centre in epidemiological surveillance and research on vector-borne diseases.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Minimise public exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke and contribute to whole-of-government efforts in reducing the prevalance of smoking. <i>[New]</i></p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Enhance the cleanliness of public spaces and foster a sense of personal and shared responsibility in keeping public spaces clean. <i>[New]</i></p>

	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>To safeguard the well-being of Singaporeans, we employ various ways to monitor and control vector-borne diseases. This includes regular surveillance and periodic checks to control vector populations as well as  carry outconducting research to study vector-borne diseases and explore better ways to control them.</p>

	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>To achieve high standards of high public health standards, we  aim to foster a sense of  increase community ownership for public health. The involvement of the wider  community and the private sector plays a pivotal role in safeguarding contributes to our our public health as we move towards greater increased self-regulation. Efforts at both the individual and collective level are necessary to mitigate public health risks attributed to vectors, second-hand tobacco smoke, and poor cleanliness issues in public spaces.</p>

	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The female Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector of dengue in Singapore. When an Aedes mosquito bites an infected person, it can pick up the virus and pass it to the next person it bites.</p>

	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Although only 10% of Singaporean adults are smokers, anyone in a public space with smokers can be affected by the effects of smoking.</p>
		<p>The Ministry takes measures to protect the health of non-smokers through the smoking prohibition act.</p>
		<p>Besides having laws in place, smokers must also take responsibility for their own actions and be considerate towards others.</p>

	<input type="checkbox" id="title5"  /><label for="title5">Our Efforts: Creating A Smoke-Free Environment</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Greater Enforcement Of Ban</em></p>
		<p>The NEA has stepped up its efforts to enforce the smoking ban by conducting daily patrols of various places, including 24-hour food and entertainment outlets. Members of the public can also report smoking violations via NEA's myENV mobile application, or <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/feedback">Online Feedback Form</a>.</p>
		<p><em>Extending The Smoking Ban To More Areas</em></p>
		<p>Efforts to protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke began in 1970 when smoking was banned in cinemas, theatres and on omnibuses. Since then, the ban has been extended to more than 49,000 premises, particularly those where it is harder for non-smokers to avoid second-hand smoke. MSE and NEA will continue to consider further extensions of the smoking prohibition from time to time.</p>

<h2>Dengue</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title6"  /><label for="title6">Dengue Can Be Fatal If Untreated</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The female Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector of dengue in Singapore. When an Aedes mosquito bites an infected person, it can pick up the virus and pass it to the next person it bites. <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/Aedes">View the map</a> showing areas with relatively higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population, and thus higher risk of dengue transmission.</p>
		<p>Residents living in areas with relatively higher Aedes aegypti mosquito populations are urged to help reduce the mosquito population by regularly practising the Mozzie Wipeout 'B-L-O-C-K' steps.</p>
		<p>The more severe forms of dengue can be fatal if not treated.</p>

	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title7"  /><label for="title7">The Challenge: Mosquitoes Breed Easily In Our Environment</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The Aedes mosquito breeds in stagnant water in man-made habitats. These can be easily found in our environment – such as pails and containers in our homes, tree holes and outdoor drains. Our tropical climate is also conducive to the maturation of the mosquito.</p>
		<p><em> The Disease Is Constantly Among Us</em></p>
		<p>Dengue is endemic in Singapore and the region. This means that the disease is always present, even if it is not always at high levels. To prevent disease transmission, it is important for us to keep mosquito numbers as low as possible at all times.</p>
		<p><em>Receive Alerts On Areas With Higher Aedes Aegypti Mosquito Populations</em></p>
		<p>Download the myENV app and view the Aedes Mosquitoes map, showing areas with relatively high Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. Add locations on the myENV app and set up notifications for Aedes mosquitoes. You will be notified if one of your locations is in an area with higher Aedes population.</p>
		<p>Download the myENV app for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/myenv/id444435182">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.nea&hl=en">Android.</a></p>

<h2>Vector Control</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title12"  /><label for="title12">Some Pests Can Carry Diseases That Affect Us</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Pests that can carry diseases are also referred to as vectors. Given Singapore’s high population density, any outbreak of vector-borne diseases is likely to spread rapidly. NEA monitors the vector population to make sure that vector-borne diseases here are kept under control.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title13"  /><label for="title13">The Challenge: Vectors Are Here To Stay</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Tougher, Adaptable Agents Of Disease</em></p>
		<p>Due to the loss of their original habitats from rapid urbanisation, these vectors have quickly adopted alternative breeding grounds in built-up areas. Coupled with increased resistance to pesticides, it is almost impossible to get rid of vectors completely.</p>
		<p><em>New Vector-Borne Diseases</em></p>
		<p>Air travel and trade mean that new vector-borne diseases can spread to Singapore through visiting travellers or returning locals.</p>
		<p><em>Favourable Climate For Breeding</em></p>
		<p>With climate change, increases in temperature and rainfall are expected. This may result in vectors thriving in new locations and maturing faster.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title14"  /><label for="title14">Our Efforts: From Reaction To Prevention</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Surveillance And Control</em></p>
		<p>NEA maintains a close watch on the rodent population to keep it under control. Since 01 June 2011, NEA's vector control technicians (VCTs) conduct systematic inspections of both HDB and non-HDB estates island-wide as part of a dedicated rodent surveillance and control team under NEA. Between 2005 and 2007, NEA co-funded a dedicated rodent control programme for HDB estates, termed "Rat Attack". There were three phases in the programme.</p>
		<p>For mosquitoes, NEA officers visit premises at least once every 3 to 6 months to check for potential breeding spots and remove existing breeding grounds. NEA also carries out virus surveillance on patient blood samples submitted by healthcare providers, to track the different variations of the dengue virus circulating in the community.</p>
		<p><em>Keeping Dengue At Bay</em></p>
		<p>While we cannot get rid of vectors completely, we have successfully kept outbreaks of diseases at bay.</p>
		<p>Since its set up in 2002, NEA’s Environmental Health Institute (EHI) has been conducting research, surveillance and risk assessments on vector-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and malaria. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of such diseases is important as it helps to minimise the chances of transmission.</p>
