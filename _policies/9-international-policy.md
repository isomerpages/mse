# Our International Policy in a Nutshell

**Partnering the World for Sustainability**

As a small country exposed to external impacts, Singapore is a strong advocate of a rules-based approach in bilateral and multilateral partnerships with countries to address environmental sustainability and climate challenges. We participate actively and constructively at various platforms, and work with all countries to push for strong, balanced, and credible outcomes at negotiations that strengthen global environmental sustainability and climate action. Collective action from all countries is needed to ensure that we make progress on our international commitments such as the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

**Our Key Issues**

The scope of international environmental sustainaiblity and climate policy is wide ranging. It includes addressing climate change, promoting circular economy, enhancing food and water security, tackling transboundary air and water pollution, and safeguarding our environment from marine litter and plastic pollution. We work with governments and stakeholders to further progress in these areas at international and regional platforms as well as through bilateral engagements and technical exchanges. 

**Our Key Platforms**

Singapore supports the global response to current and emerging environmental issues at both regional and international platforms. These platforms include the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), UN General Assembly (UNGA), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). 

Singapore is an active participant at these platforms and supports many of their outcomes, activities, and initiatives. These include the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, the Paris Agreement, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda). 

**Our Key Partners**

Singapore's engagement with the international community extends beyond multilateral platforms. We also advance the global sustainability agenda by working with other countries, such as through regular high-level policy forums, facilitating business missions and forging collaborative partnerships as well as joint research and development and capacity building efforts, and exchanging knowledge and best practices. We also ensure that provisions in our trade agreements contribute to both economic growth and environmental sustainability, and support climate action and the green economy. Singapore believes that we can solve many environmental and sustainability issues when we collaborate and share knowledge. 

**Sharing Our Experiences**

Global challenges, such as climate change, transboundary pollution, food and water security, need global solutions. We can facilitate the delivery of these solutions by sharing best practices and working in close partnership with the international community, businesses, academia and civil society. 

Singapore has been sharing our experience and providing capacity-building support on sustainable development and climate action to other developing countries through technical assistance programmes. Under the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP), which is Singaporeâ€™s flagship technical assistance platform established in 1992, we have run capacity building programmes for about 150,000 officials from over 180 countries, territories and intergovernmental organisations, in areas such as water and sanitation and sustainable cities. Our programmes are linked to the SDGs. In 2022, Singapore launched the Sustainability Action Package (SAP) to support the capacity-building needs of developing countries on sustainability and climate change. This includes decarbonisation, building resilience for water and food security, managing and financing green projects, developing sustainable infrastructure, and managing carbon markets. 

In addition, Singapore organises the Singapore International Agri-Food Week (SIAW) which is an annual event that spotlights innovation in supply chain resilience, urban food systems, alternative proteins and affordable nutrition. Singapore also organises the Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) and Clean Enviro-Summit Singapore (CESG) biennially. These are part of a series of sustainability events which bring global environmental and climate leaders, experts, and practitioners together to tap business opportunities and to advance innovative solutions in food, water and environment management.
