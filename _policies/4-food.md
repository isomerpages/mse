<h2>Food Security</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title3"  /><label for="title3">Singapore's Food Story: Ensuring and Securing Food Supply</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore imports more than 90 percent of our food and we operate in a global environment where we face a multitude of risks such as volatilities of the global food market, impacts of climate change, geopolitical decisions, and disease outbreaks. To mitigate and overcome these challenges, the collective efforts of the government, industry and consumers are required to strengthen our food supply resilience.</p>
		<p>SFA safeguards Singapore’s food supply through a multi-pronged food security strategy, which includes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Import source diversifications – By diversifying our food sources, we reduce our reliance on any single source for any one food item. This is our core strategy, and we continue to facilitate food imports from new sources, by working closely with industry and governments globally. Should there be a food supply disruption, Singapore is in a good position to work with the industry to tap on alternative food sources, and ensure that our food supply remains stable.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Stockpiling - The Government works closely with industry partners to maintain adequate stockpiles of essential food items that can meet our nutritional needs during a severe food supply disruption or emergency.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Local production – By growing our capability and capacity to produce food locally, this can serve as a buffer in the event of a food supply disruption.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title4"  /><label for="title4">"30 By 30" Vision</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Under the "30 by 30" vision, SFA seeks to build up our agri-food industry's capability and capacity to produce 30% of our nutitional needs locally by 2030. While the 30 by 30 vision is aspirational considering that we produce less than 10% of our nutritional needs today, SFA continues to work with the agri-food industry to 'grow more with less', and in a productive, resource-efficient, and climate-resilient way.</p>
		<p>SFA works with the agri-food industry and relevant stakeholders to: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Develop spaces for agri-food production: To expand local food production, SFA tenders out spaces to agri-food companies with promising farming models through a competitive land tender basis.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Adopt innovative technologies: SFA provides funding support to the industry to adopt innovative technologies. This includes grants to co-fund farming systems that can better control environmental variables and boost production capabilities.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Catalyse R&D innovation: R&D plays a key role to drive innovation and plug existing technological gaps. To support the "30 by 30" vision, research funding has been made available under the Singapore Food Story R&D programme to enable R&D in three areas –sustainable urban food production, future foods, and food safety science & innovation.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Develop a local pipeline for the agri-food workforce: As the agri-food industry grows and transforms, new and higher value jobs requiring  multi-disciplinary expertise in science, engineering, and info-communications will be needed. SFA is working with various Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and local farms on programmes such as diploma courses and structured internship programmes to equip students and adult job seekers with skillsets that will lead to meaningful, specialised careers in agriculture and aquaculture.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Rally support for local produce: As we ramp up local production, we will need the support of consumers and businesses to sustain a healthy and vibrant agri-food ecosystem, and help our farms remain commercially viable. Local produce is fresher, which means it can last longer. It also incurs lesser carbon miles, as the produce does not need to be transported across long distances before reaching the consumer. To make it easier for consumers to identify local produce, SFA has launched an “SG Fresh Produce” logo which can be found on the packaging of local produce in retail shops and supermarkets. SFA also launched the Farm-To-Table Recognition Programme (FTTRP) in 2023 to recognise food businesses that procure locally farmed produce. Consumers can identify and support food establishements that use locally produced ingredients by looking out for the Farm-To-Table logos. By choosing locally produced food, all of us can play a part in enhancing Singapore’s food security.</p>

<h2 id="food-safety">Food Safety</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title1"  /><label for="title1">Safe Food For All</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>As the national agency for food safety, SFA has in place an integrated food safety system from farm-to-fork to ensure that food sold in Singapore is safe for consumption. SFA adopts a science-based risk assessment and management approach to food safety, and sets food safety standards that are aligned  with international standards. SFA has in place regulatory levers along the food supply chain including licensing, inspection, sampling, testing and enforcement.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Overseas sources and imports – Food importers are licensed by SFA, and are required to apply for import permits for each consignment of food imported into Singapore. For high-risk food items like livestock, meat and eggs that can carry diseases that can be transmitted to people, SFA conducts accreditation at source to ensure that the imports meet food safety and animal health requirements.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Local farms and food establishments – SFA licenses farms and food establishments in Singapore, including slaughterhouses, food processing/manufacturing establishments, as well as various food retail establishments such as hawker and market stalls, coffeeshops, food courts, food caterers, canteens, supermarkets, mobile food wagons, cafes, and restaurants. Inspections are carried out to ensure that these establishments comply with licensing conditions and regulatory requirements.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the event of food safety incidents, SFA carries out investigations and activates response measures to manage the risk to public health (e.g. food recalls, movement control directions to suspend operations or stop sale of food).</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title2"  /><label for="title2">Food Safety is a Joint Responsibility: Role of Industry and Consumers</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>With food safety being a joint responsibility, SFA works with the industry and consumers to build their capabilities and educate them on their roles in ensuring food safety. For instance, food handlers in restaurants, hawker stalls and coffee shops must attend and pass the Food Safety Course Level 1 before they are allowed to work.</p>
		<p>For consumers, SFA has made available food safety information and tips online to equip consumers with knowledge of food safety risks and good food safety practices. Examples include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-information/risk-at-a-glance">Risk at a glance</a></p>
			</li>
			<li><p><a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-for-thought">Food for Thought content hub</a></p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Food safety tips:<a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-safety-tips">Food Safety Tips</a></p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Track records (hygiene grading, number of demerit points and suspension history) of the food establishment:<a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-retail/licensing-permits"> Food Retail Licence</a></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Consumers who come across any errant food operator can play your part by reporting these operators to SFA via the <a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/feedback">online feedback form.</a></p>
