The [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/) is the United Nations’ body for assessing the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for mitigation and adaptation.  IPCC assessments provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies and contribute to global climate action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
