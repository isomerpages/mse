The [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/) is the United Nations’ body for assessing the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for mitigation and adaptation.  IPCC assessments provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies and contribute to global climate action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Singapore has been invited to nominate experts for consideration as Coordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors and Review Editors to contribute to the production of the following IPCC reports:

a. [IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Cities](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/special-report-on-climate-change-and-cities/) (scheduled to be released in March 2027); and <br>
b. [2027 IPCC Methodology Report on Inventories for Short-lived Climate Forcers](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/methodology-report-on-short-lived-climate-forcers/) (scheduled to be considered by the Panel in the second half of 2027).
 
The call for author nominations follows agreement on the outlines and timelines of the two reports at the 61st Session of the IPCC held in Sofia, Bulgaria from 27 July to 2 August 2024. The outlines of the two reports can be accessed at the following links:

a. [Outline of IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Cities](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2024/08/Decision_Cities.pdf); and <br>
b. [Outline of 2027 IPCC Methodology Report on Inventories for Short-lived Climate Forcers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2024/08/Decision_SLCF.pdf)
 
Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors are responsible for drafting the different chapters of the reports and revising those based on comments submitted during the review process, while review editors are responsible for assisting the Working Group/Task Force Bureau in identifying reviewers for the expert review process. Please refer to the [IPCC website](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/09/ipcc-principles-appendix-a-final.pdf) (Annex 1) for more details of the roles and responsibilities for the various authors.
