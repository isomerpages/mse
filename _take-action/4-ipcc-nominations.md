The [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/) is the United Nationsâ€™ body for assessing the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for mitigation and adaptation.  IPCC assessments provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies and contribute to global climate action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Singapore has been invited to nominate experts for consideration as Coordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors and Review Editors to contribute to the production of the following IPCC reports:
