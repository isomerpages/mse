**Can projects receive other sources of funding in addition to the SG Eco Fund?**

Applicants are not allowed to receive funding from more than one government grant scheme for the same project. However, applicants can still seek funding from other non-government sources. Applicants will be required to declare their funding sources in the application form.

**How long would it take for the application to be approved?**

Evaluation of Main applications could take up to four months, after the closure of the grant call. The actual time taken depends on the nature of the project, the completeness of the information submitted, and the grant quantum.

For Sprout applications, the process could take up to two months, after the closure of the grant call. Actual time may vary depending on the availability and timing of the pitch presentations.

**Can applicants submit more than one application for the SG Eco Fund?**

Applicants may submit more than one project application, but will have to show that they have enough manpower and resources to manage multiple projects. For applicants submitting to both funding categories (Sprout and Main), projects should be distinct from each other.

**Can applicants re-submit a project to the SG Eco Fund that has been rejected previously?**

Applicants are discouraged from submitting the same project to the SG Eco Fund, unless significant changes have been made to a project proposal to align it better with the funding criteria.

**How will the grant be disbursed?**

Grants will be given out on a reimbursement basis upon completion of project milestones. The project milestones and deliverables will be set and agreed by both applicant and the Trust before the commencement of the project.

Upon achieving agreed milestones and deliverables, the applicant should submit these documents within one month of milestone date:

- Project progress/completion report
- For projects with approved funding quantum of $30,000 or below, applicants shall submit original/certified true copies of invoices/payment records.
- For projects with approved funding quantum of more than S$30,000, applicants will have to engage an auditor and submit a report of factual findings.

The claim for the final reimbursement should be submitted within three months of the project completion date.

If the applicant requires some upfront funding after approval of the application, please write in to the Trust SG Eco Office and provide reasons for the request.

**Can the grant be used to support expenses that were incurred before the award of the grant?**

Only expenses incurred _after_ the applicant&#39;s acceptance of the Letter of Offer will be eligible for reimbursement.

**How should receipts be submitted?**

As receipts printed on thermal paper (e.g. supermarket receipt) will fade over time, please make a copy of the receipt for submission. We reserve the right to exclude receipts that are unclear or faded from the total project cost.

**Do applicants need to audit their invoices and payment records?**

For projects with an approved grant quantum exceeding S$30,000, applicants will have to engage an auditor and submit a report of factual findings for each claim. The cost of engaging the auditor should be included in the project budget during application.

**How do applicants amend their application or provide additional information?**

Once a grant application is submitted, applicants will no longer be able to make any amendments. For amendment of critical fields such as project dates and budget amount, applicants may contact the Trust via email to put forth the request. It will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

**Who owns the Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) arising from the project?**

BThe Grant Recipient and the SG Eco Fund Board of Trustees will co-own all IPRs arising from or created in relation to the Project. The SG Eco Fund retains the rights to utilise IPRs for charitable purposes.
