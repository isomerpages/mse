# Forward Singapore's Steward Pillar

Forward Singapore is an opportunity for all of us to come together, examine our values and aspirations, build consensus, and refresh our social compact.

Through this exercise, we will examine what we want to see for Singapore’s future, what we should prioritise, and what each of us is willing to contribute, in order to get there.

## Working Together for a Green, Liveable and Climate-Resilient Singapore

As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, we seek to engage all segments of society to discuss the challenges, constraints as well as opportunities that Singapore faces as we tackle climate change, the trade-offs that Singapore has to balance, our priorities moving forward, and how we can all contribute to realise our vision for the future.

We are calling for individuals, educational institutions and organisations to [make pledges](http://go.gov.sg/greennationpledge) to contribute to a green, liveable and climate-resilient Singapore. For each pledge category, there are three tiers: Contributor, Advocate or Champion. Respondents can also choose to pledge as individuals or on behalf of their school / organisation. You are also encouraged to share your pledge by uploading it on your social media accounts with the hashtag #GreenNationPledgeSG.


## Public Engagements under the Steward Pillar

#### National Youth Dialogue on Moving Towards a Net Zero Future
Youths were invited to participate in a dialogue to explore the challenges and opportunities in store for Singapore as we move towards net zero, and the role of youths, businesses and civil society/academia in catalysing change in norms and attitudes. 

#### Our Coastal Conversation (City-East Coast)
Members of public were invited to participate in PUB’s community dialogue sessions to hear from experts on coastal and flood protection strategies and approaches, and share their views and ideas on how we can transform Singapore’s coastlines along City-East Coast to protect ourselves from the impacts of climate change in the next few decades. 

#### Public consultation on proposed Beverage Container Return Scheme
The National Environment Agency is implementing a beverage container return scheme as part of efforts to reduce waste, and make Singapore a Zero Waste Nation. Members of public were invited to provide views on the proposed scheme, particularly on the type of beverage containers to be covered, deposit amount, and return point locations.
