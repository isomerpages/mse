<h1><b>Research & Innovation</b></h1>
<p>Research & Innovation is a key enabler for Singapore to overcome our natural constraints. The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and our statutory boards - the National Environment Agency (NEA), PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) - invests in Research & Development and builds Science & Technology capabilities to address climate change, environmental sustainability, water and food security issues, and other challenges.</p>
<p>We welcome the private sector and research partners to join us to co-develop innovative solutions and technologies to address these complex, cross-cutting challenges.</p>

It funds R&D to tackle key waste streams like e-waste, plastics and food, and to invent useful and safe applications for treated waste residues. CTRL contributes to our efforts towards meeting the <a href"https:www.greenplan.gov.sg">Singapore Green Plan</a> targets and to pursue a circle economy under the <a href="https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/zero-waste-masterplan">Zero Waste Masterplan</a>. </p>
		<p>CTRL seeks to increase resource recovery, prolong the lifespan of the Semakau Landfill, promote environmental sustainability, raise digitalisation and automation in Singapore’s waste management sector, and mitigate carbon emissions arising from waste treatment and disposal. </p>
		<p>It comprises three broad R&D tracks: <br>(1) Resource Recovery - treatment and recovery of resources from key waste streams, <br>(2) Residues as Resources - treatment of residue streams and the safe applications of these treated materials, <br>(3) Rethinking energy from waste - development of novel solutions to maximise energy and resource recovery while minimising carbon emissions. </p>
