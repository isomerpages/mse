<h2><b>Marine Litter</b></h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="p1-1"  /><label for="p1-1">A Global Problem</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><span>Marine litter, sometimes referred to as marine debris, is defined as &ldquo;any persistent, manufactured, or processed solid material that is discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> It comes in many forms and includes plastic bags, glass, wood and tyres. Marine litter comes from many sources, and is moved across the oceans by prevailing winds and tides. Globally, 80% of marine litter comes from land-based sources, particularly landfills, rivers and floodwaters, industrial outfalls, discharge from storm water drains, untreated municipal sewerage, and littering of beaches and coastal areas.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Rapidly increasing levels of marine litter, including plastic litter and microplastics, are a serious environmental problem on a global scale. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plastics are considered the most persistent and problematic of the different types of marine litter.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[3]</span></span></span></a> More than 150 million tonnes of plastic are estimated to have been dumped in the world&rsquo;s oceans, with about 8 million tonnes added every year. The duration required for these plastics to biodegrade completely is in the hundreds of years. The buoyant characteristic of plastic litter, combined with its slow biodegrading nature, leads to tremendous dispersal potential in our oceans.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, larger plastic objects when weathered and fragmented become microplastics, operationally defined as small particles or fragments measuring less than 5 millimetres in diameter.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[4]</span></span></span></a> These microplastics are easily ingested by marine creatures and can potentially cause harm to human and environmental health.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[5]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Marine litter poses environmental, economic, health, cultural and aesthetic threats, including the loss of biodiversity and degradation of marine and coastal habitats and ecosystems. Marine wildlife such as whales, turtles, seabirds, and crustaceans are especially vulnerable to plastic marine litter as it disrupts their digestion and causes physical lacerations and entanglement. Floating plastics contribute to the spread of invasive organisms that can disrupt ecosystems. Marine plastic litter can leach chemicals used in its production and pose a threat to human health. Litter on coasts also affects the aesthetic value of tourist destinations leading to decreased tourism-related income, and major financial costs related to the cleaning and maintaining of coasts. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Marine litter is also a transboundary issue. It is transported across seas through ocean currents and waves. One example is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch of marine litter from around the world. A 2011 United Nations Environment Programme Report stated that marine litter has been found even in the most remote places on Earth with few or no humans present, such as on St Brandon&rsquo;s Islands in the Indian Ocean.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[6]</span></span></span></a> In Singapore, we have also seen increased landings of marine litter on our shores during the monsoon season. It is thus imperative that the issue of marine litter is addressed through collective and coordinated action on a national, regional, and global level, in line with Target 14.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[7]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a responsible global citizen, Singapore recognises our role in contributing to the collective response to tackling marine litter and microplastics. This National Action Strategy aims to summarise and outline Singapore&rsquo;s various actions and measures to combat the issue of marine litter.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>Singapore’s Context</b></h2>

<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="p2-1"/><label for="p2-1">Marine and Coastal Landscape</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><span>Singapore is a small and heavily urbanised island-state in Southeast Asia situated at the southern tip of the Malayan Peninsula between Malaysia and Indonesia. Located between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, Singapore is bordered on the north by the narrow Johor Strait, which separates it from Peninsular Malaysia, and on the south by the Singapore Strait (Figure 1). The Johor Strait is divided into East and West Johor Straits by the Singapore-Malaysia causeway. The Strait receives water mainly from Sungai Johor and Sungai Pulai, both located in Malaysia.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:center;'><span>Figure 1: Map of Singapore<br>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Biogeographically, Singapore is enclosed between two of the largest marine ecoregions of the world &ndash; the Western Indo-Pacific and Central Indo-Pacific regions<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> &ndash; and additionally sits near the Coral Triangle. &nbsp;While Singapore is one of the smallest countries in the world with a total land area of 728 square kilometres (as of 2020) and a 511-kilometre coastline, our waters and coastline harbour relatively rich marine biodiversity, and are home to 12 of the 23 species of Indo-Pacific seagrass, 31 true mangrove plant species (two-thirds of that in Asia), over 250 species of hard corals (a quarter of the world&rsquo;s 800 species), over 200 species of sponges, over 60 species of echinoderms, over 50 species of sea anemones and many other species of marine plants and animals.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>In 2020, Singapore established the Interagency Taskforce on Marine Litter, to coordinate and implement marine litter policies across our government agencies. The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment chairs the Taskforce, which consists of nine agencies. The National Environment Agency (NEA) and the National Parks Board (NParks) provide technical support to the Taskforce, including through research projects and studies.</p>

<h2><b>Principles</b></h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="p3-1"  /><label for="p3-1">Principles</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><span>The challenge of marine litter is a multifaceted one, and each country has its own unique circumstances. Any approach to reduce marine litter must be tailored specifically to the needs of the country and local geographies, with no &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; solution. Furthermore, the complexity of the marine litter challenge means that a whole of nation approach is needed, to ensure we can tackle the issue holistically. This includes working closely with stakeholders from various sectors to understand the issue and develop solutions together, and to bring about the enduring and sustainable changes needed to reduce and prevent marine litter. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the largest quantity of marine litter entering oceans in the region stems from land-based sources, it is imperative to place focus on waste reduction and waste management. Singapore is committed to addressing both land-based and sea-based sources of marine litter through the measures outlined in this National Action Strategy, which is guided by the core principles of sustainable development and a circular economy approach, and supports the achievement of global goals, such as SDG 14.1. The priority areas for the National Action Strategy are as follows:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;margin-left:44px;">
    <li>Reduction of Land-Based Sources of Litter</li>
    <li>Reduction of Sea-Based Sources of Litter</li>
    <li>Circular Economy Approach</li>
    <li>Research &amp; Development</li>
    <li>Maintaining and Strengthening Outreach &amp; Stakeholder Engagement</li>
    <li>International Engagement and Collaboration</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The National Action Strategy will undergo regular reviews. This will ensure that Singapore adapts quickly to new circumstances and opportunities, in line with the collective global, regional and national imperatives. The following section broadly outlines the various policy actions which seek to address the issue of marine litter both internationally and domestically.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<input type="checkbox" id="p4-1"  /><label for="p4-1">Reduction of Land-Based Sources of Litter</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Globally, land-based waste is the largest source of marine litter. To minimise the waste at source and prevent discharge of litter into the sea, countries need to prevent and reduce land-based sources of marine pollution through stringent regulations on pollution control and waste management. Countries also need to have in place a comprehensive waste and water management system to prevent any leakage of such waste into the seas and ocean. 
In Singapore, we have minimised marine litter from land-based sources in the following ways:</p>
		<p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
		<li><b>Control of waste collection and disposal</b><br>
Through the Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA), NEA ensures there is a comprehensive and integrated waste collection and management system in Singapore. All waste from municipal, commercial and industrial sources in Singapore are collected for disposal or recycling. NEA also controls the discharge of trade effluent, oil, chemical, sewage or other polluting matters into drains, as well as hazardous substances into inland waters. The EPHA also includes strict anti-littering regulations.</li>

	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore currently has a suite of comprehensive, science-based measures to address the issue of marine litter. Further studies are being carried out to build upon our existing knowledge base to help us deepen our understanding of the scope and scale of marine litter, specific to Singapore’s context. This will enable us to further sharpen our efforts and put in place more targeted measures, particularly with regard to the movement or pathways of marine litter and their effects on the ecosystem.<br>
Addressing marine litter requires national action. The Government works in partnership with our communities and stakeholders, to put in place enduring solutions to tackle this challenge. This National Action Strategy on Marine Litter seeks to galvanise and invigorate further efforts from all sectors of society, which will be critical in bring about lasting change. Through this whole of nation approach, we hope to ensure Singaporeans, for generations to come, can continue to enjoy the coastal and marine environment that surrounds our island home.
