<p><em>"Street hawkers were common in yesteryears.  Along the way home from school, we saw uncles selling peanut pancakes, ice kachang balls and others.  Oblivious to hygiene at that time, I looked forward to see the uncles as I could patronise their stalls and eat what I was allowed to buy."</em></p>

<p><em>"Affectionately referred to as “truck with 32 doors', these trucks used for transporting human waste from 'toilet' sheds in kampongs and old houses in town without proper toilet facilities to the sewerage treatment centres.  Needless to say, the smell from the gusts of winds from such a passing truck is something I can remember for life."</em></p>
