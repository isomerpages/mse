*A knowledgeable tropical rainforest ecologist, Dr Lum oversees a long term study of the dynamics of the Bukit Timah forest. His work on forest fragmentation and regeneration has aided the protection of Singapore’s forests and formed the basis for public outreach of our natural heritage.*

An influential and well respected leader within the nature community, Dr Shawn Kaihekulani Yamauchi Lum’s leadership of the Nature Society (Singapore) since 2008 has been associated with many conservation and outreach initiatives that aim to make nature part of the Singaporean identity.

Acutely aware of the importance of engaging partners, Dr Lum worked with Sentosa Development Corporation and schools to protect endangered tree species under the Sentosa Green Wave Project. He advised landscape architect colleagues on the Jurong Eco-garden, a nature friendly project that won a President’s Design Award in 2014. Dr Lum’s invaluable contributions to Singapore’s biodiversity could also be seen in his caring for rare primary forest tree seedlings where he helped the Hopea Sangal trees escape extinction in 2002.

What sets Dr Lum apart is his ability to bring 3P partners together to seek consensus on conservation issues and his tactful mediation tactics between different agencies and citizens in pursuing solutions to balance development and conservation of green spaces. As a member of the Water Network Panel under PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, he also provides valuable advice on water conservation issues.

A knowledgeable tropical rainforest ecologist, Dr Lum oversees a long term study of the dynamics of the Bukit Timah forest. His work on forest fragmentation and regeneration has aided the protection of Singapore’s forests and formed the basis for public outreach of our natural heritage. He was also part of a long-term system to monitor carbon stock changes in the land use sector. These findings are submitted to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to benefit the global community.

As a leader in environmental conservation, Dr Shawn Lum is a deserving recipient of the President’s Award for the Environment 2017.

#### Khoo Teck Puat Hospital

*As a champion for biodiversity, KTPH painstakingly conserves and documents about 700 local and native trees, 700 indoor potted plants, 70 species of birds and 80 species of butterflies.*

Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) builds on its strong foundation in sustainability since its opening in 2010 to instil green values beyond its staff by involving patients and the Yishun community. Sustainability events are conducted throughout the year, with quarterly litter picking sessions and monthly gardening session for staff members and the public. KTPH works closely with the Yishun community for its Eco-garden. The fruits of their labour benefits the local community, with sales of their produce subsidising the operation of the Eco-garden.
 
As a champion for biodiversity, KTPH painstakingly conserves and documents about 700 local and native trees, 700 indoor potted plants, 70 species of birds and 80 species of butterflies, which in turn enhance the natural environment of the hospital. The hospital has also adopted the Yishun Pond under the PUB's Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters Programme, transforming the pond into a bustling area where everyone can exercise to keep fit while appreciating its natural beauty. In a bid to further expand the pond’s greenery and biodiversity, KTPH initiated floating bunds at Yishun Pond to grow water plants and attract wetland birds.
 
KTPH embraces green technology by implementing the first Energy Display Dashboard within the healthcare industry in 2016 to measure unusual energy usage and promote energy conservation among staff. Efficient irrigation and condensation system implemented within the hospital has reduced water consumption by 3% in 2016. Looking towards the future, KTPH is conducting research to optimise its hot water system such that it can be powered by a renewable solar thermal system, thereby further reducing energy usage.
 
With its outstanding efforts in environmental protection and sustainability, KTPH is deserving of the President’s Award for the Environment 2017.

*Demonstrating a strong commitment towards environmental protection, AGPS incorporates environmental programmes on water education, the 3Rs of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle, and climate change in its curriculum for Primary 1 to Primary 6 levels.*

Anchor Green Primary School (AGPS) grooms its pupils to be aspiring and gracious learners who actively contribute to the environment and the community with a culture of care, collaboration and innovation. Pupils and staff actively involve themselves in conservation activities in the community such as the staff Amazing Race @ Sengkang Floating Wetland in 2015 and guided tours of the flora and fauna of the wetland for the community by the pupils. In partnerships with PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency and Waterways Watch Society, staff picked up litter along Marina Barrage and Punggol Waterway in support of Singapore World Water Day 2015.  With a strong tradition of sustained commitment in recycling, AGPS continues to collaborate with IKEA, Brother Singapore, WWF Singapore and National Parks Board to promote school-wide recycling efforts and resource conservation.

AGPS ignites school-wide environmental consciousness by training Environment Champions and Green Club members who go on to educate others on green initiatives. Demonstrating a strong commitment towards environmental protection, AGPS incorporates environmental programmes on water education, the 3Rs of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle, and climate change in its curriculum for Primary 1 to Primary 6 levels.

As an early adopter of green technology, AGPS is one of the first ten schools to use a food digester, under Love Your Food @ AGPS 2017 initiative, by the National Environment Agency to encourage waste minimisation. The school also installed water saving devices, leading to 5% saving in water and electrical bills, demonstrating their commitment towards conservation and sustainability.

With their dedication to environmental education and the promotion of environmental consciousness in collaboration with the wider community, AGPS is truly deserving of the President’s Award for the Environment 2017.
