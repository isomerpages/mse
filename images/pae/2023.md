Mr Jacob Tan Guan Rui is an exemplary role model for championing environmental sustainability at Commonwealth Secondary School (CWSS) and in the wider community. At CWSS, he oversees its Environmental Education programme and championed various initiatives on biodiversity and conservation, plastic disposables reduction, food security and resource conservation. 

In 2021 when CWSS was appointed as one of the pilot schools for the MOE Eco-Stewardship Programme under the SG Green Plan, Mr Tan led a team of teachers and students in mapping out the school’s existing environmental-related initiatives and programmes. They formed the CWSS Green Plan, making sustainability a key theme on the Campus, and connecting with the Community beyond the school. 

Mr Tan’s passion for environmental advocacy extends beyond CWSS to the wider community. He is involved in the W7 Environmental Education Cluster Learning Team where he mentors students from different schools to lend their efforts towards influencing other youths in schools to take positive strides towards environmental sustainability.

Since embarking on its environmental sustainability journey more than two decades ago, the National University of Singapore has remained committed to advancing sustainable development and contributing to the global fight against climate change. 

In 2022, NUS charted out its long-term strategic goals through a Campus Sustainability Roadmap 2030 which focuses on the University progressing towards a Carbon Neutral, Climate Resilient and Zero Waste campus. Sustainability is at the core of NUS’ campus design. Notably, the University Town was Singapore’s first Green Mark Gold Plus district, while the School of Design and Environment 4 was the first purpose built Net Zero Energy building in Southeast Asia. 

In 2023, NUS also launched its first building cluster targeting Net Zero Energy. Other sustainability efforts by NUS include its commitment to plant 100,000 trees by 2030, and the Towards a Zero Waste NUS Action Plan 2030, complemented by various sustainability projects undertaken by its network of student advocates.

Additionally, the University has been recognised with several sustainability accolades in the built environment, such as the BCA Green Mark Platinum Champion Award, the International Living Future Institute Zero Energy Certification, several NParks’ Landscape Excellence Assessment Framework Certifications as well as the ASEAN Energy Awards.
