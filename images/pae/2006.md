*They are an excellent example of how ordinary members of the public can do their part for the environment*

Waterways Watch Society’s programmes in increasing awareness among students, community and corporate entities on the importance of keeping our waterways clean are highly commendable. They are an excellent example of how ordinary members of the public can do their part for the environment.

A special volunteer group formed in 1998 to monitor, restore and protect the aesthetics of our waterways, WWS’ mission is to keep the Singapore’s water ways clean and free of pollution by educating the public on the importance of keeping our waterways clean.

The 100-member volunteer group has been doing river patrols almost every Sunday in the Kallang Basin/ Singapore River area, and conducted numerous outreach and educational programmes to raise the awareness among the public, especially the young, on the importance of keeping out waterways clean. WWS volunteers have also participated actively in PUB’s Water Efficient Homes exhibitions.

As one of the “adopters” under the PUB’s “Our Waters” programme, Waterways Watch Society has been providing regular feedback to the authorities during their river patrol to help curb pollution at its source. In addition, they have also helped to spread the environmental message through their involvement in events like the Clean and Green Week, International Coastal Clean-up and World Water Monitoring Day.

WWS has turned their attention towards educating students through numerous school educational activities and programmes for schools and individuals to instil the spirit of "keeping our waterways clean and green".
