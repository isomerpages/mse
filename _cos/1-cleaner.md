## Cleaner premises through collective efforts

Even as we manage the immediate challenges brought about by COVID-19, we must seize the opportunity to raise cleanliness and hygiene standards for the long term to shore up our public health defences and guard against future threats. This is in line with our SG Clean movement. 

Following the passing of amendments to the Environmental Public Health Act in Parliament, the National Environmental Agency (NEA) will roll out the new Environmental Sanitation regime from mid-2021, starting with higher-risk premises with high footfall and/or immuno-vulnerable occupants. More than 2,000 premises are expected to implement the regime by end FY2021. NEA will release a Technical Guide with national baseline Environmental Sanitation guidelines, along with sector-specific standards to guide premises owners. The first batch of Environmental Control Coordinators will start their training from March 2021, to support the implementation of Environmental Sanitation programmes at their premises.

NEA will continue to work with the environmental services (ES) industry to raise professionalism and productivity, and enhance jobs in the sector. To promote the adoption of better procurement practices, it will roll out a refreshed outcome-based contracting (OBC) guide for cleaning services in Q1 2021. This will help service buyers in assessing service outcomes, and better prepare cleaning companies and service buyers to deal with any additional cleaning and disinfection work when required. An OBC guide for the pest management sector is targeted to be ready by end 2021. NEA will also facilitate the adoption of automation in the ES industry by extending the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) to September 2021.

As more people dine out during Phase 3 Safe Reopening, we must continue to keep our public dining places safe by keeping them clean. NEA launched the [Clean Tables Campaign](https://www.sgclean.gov.sg/join/for-individuals/clean-tables-campaign/) in Feb 2021 to galvanise individuals and the community to do our part to return used crockery and trays, and clear and bin our own litter such as used tissues and wet wipes. This shows consideration for the next diner, and allows cleaners to focus on the most important task of cleaning and disinfecting tables. This self-service approach is also a more sustainable way of keeping our dining places clean.
